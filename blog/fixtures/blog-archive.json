    "title": "What is FinTech?",
    "text": "<p>I've been at Wharton for four weeks now and have had the chance to meet and get to know some truly incredible people; students and professionals from an array of varied backgrounds, all of whom have accomplishments in their respective fields to be proud of. When I begin to explain to people my background and what I plan to do, inevitably the topic of financial technology, or FinTech, comes up. The question that seems to arise more often than not is, \"what exactly is FinTech, anyway?\" People often have experience in some part of the industry but don't necessarily appreciate the breadth of the whole financial technology space. I admit that after discussing this with the rest of the club, we found ourselves without a simple definition that encapsulates the plethora of firms and opportunities that inhabit the FinTech landscape. In order to rectify that glaring omission in our repertoire of FinTech evangelism, the Wharton FinTech Club would like to present the following definition:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>Fin\u00b7Tech <em>noun</em> : an economic industry composed of companies that use technology to make financial systems more efficient.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>While my <a href=\"http://whartonfintech.org/\">Wharton FinTech Club</a> colleagues and I think this definition succinctly and comprehensively captures what we mean when we use the words \"FinTech\" or \"finanical technology\", I am sure there are people in the industry that will disagree with us. This definition may be too narrow or too broad, or perhaps \"efficient\" is not exactly the correct word to use as the defining adjective to classify the goal of FinTech companies. That said, we are open to discussion on whether this parsimonious definition can be improved upon and if it is a formal description that the industry is willing to embrace. However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whartonFinTech\">my colleagues</a> and I are going to use this as our working definition for the time being.</p>\r\n<p>So, now that we've got a definition of \u201cFinTech\u201d, I should probably elaborate on exactly what it entails. FinTech companies cover a wide range of sub-industries, from crowdfunding (<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\">Kickstarter</a>) and peer-to-peer lending (<a href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/\">Lending Club</a>) to algorithmic asset management (<a href=\"https://www.wealthfront.com/\">WealthFront</a>) and thematic investing (<a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/\">Motif Investing</a>). FinTech companies also operate in payments (<a href=\"https://www.xoom.com/\">Xoom</a>), data collection (<a href=\"http://www.inside-analytics.com/\">2iQ Research</a>), credit scoring (<a href=\"http://www.zestfinance.com/\">ZestFinance</a>), education lending (<a href=\"https://commonbond.co/\">CommonBond</a>), digital currency (<a href=\"https://coinbase.com/\">Coinbase</a>), exchanges (<a href=\"https://www.secondmarket.com/\">SecondMarket</a>), working capital management (<a href=\"https://www.tesorio.com/\">Tesorio</a>), cyber security (<a href=\"http://www.idgatecorp.com/english/\">iDGate</a>) and even quantum computing (<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2014/09/02/FinTech-innovation-lab-in-hong-kong-launches-with-eight-firms/\">QxBranch</a>). Despite operating in such a diverse set of domains, these companies share a common attribute: they build and implement technology which is used to make financial markets and systems more efficient. And while the companies I mentioned above represent only a handful of the spaces and companies that are included under the umbrella of FinTech, I hope to learn and write about these and many more over the coming months.</p>\r\n<p>A recent report by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City, \"<a href=\"http://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NY-FinTech-Report-2014.pdf\">The Rise of FinTech - New York\u2019s Opportunity for Tech Leadership</a>\", indicates that global investment in FinTech ventures has tripled from around $1 billion in 2008 to nearly $3 billion in 2013. This growth is exciting for obvious reasons. However, what is most interesting, and I think somewhat unique to FinTech, is the fact that this investment in innovation appears to be occurring in a relatively geographically decentralized manner. In the US for instance, Silicon Valley and New York rank as the number one and number two clusters for FinTech, with $376 million and $151.4 million of total investments in the first quarter of 2014, respectively. While these numbers are not exactly on par, growth in the New York market has been double that of Silicon Valley over the last five years and <a href=\"http://www.fintechinnovationlab.com/\">NYC is making a push</a> to establish itself as an equal complement to it's West Coast counterpart. Investment in the space is a big focus for the Wharton FinTech club so expect to see more on this in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, there is a lot of very cool technology being developed and deployed by FinTech companies. Whether the application of cryptocurrency block chains to problems such as <a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/final-winners-mit-app-contest/\">online identity</a> or leveraging large unstructured social media data sources to <a href=\"http://on.wsj.com/ZZAiLG\">make better underwiritng decisions</a>, there are a lot of reasons to care about the space beyond the economic and business potential. Again, this is a perspective that we will be covering in detail so stay tuned.</p>\r\n<p>I'd like to end with a thought that has come up during a number of conversations I have had with entrepreneurs, investors and students: the biggest obstacles to success for financial technology companies appear to be neither financial nor technological, but rather psychological. By this I mean that there are lots of ways that FinTech companies can improve financial systems with existing technology and technology in development. However, the space has for decades been dominated by big firms that can often be resistant to change, the big banks being prime examples of this. Overcoming regulation and institutional inertia, and gaining the public's trust will be key to ensuring widespread adoption of new financial technologies.</p>\r\n<p>After having reshaped almost every aspect of our lives, technology-enabled startups are poised to genuinely disrupt the domain of these sleeping giants and I think the big firms know this. Nearly all the major banks and financial services firms are either actively incubating or facilitating the development of startups and their technology in the FinTech space. The Wharton FinTech Club is looking forward to writing about, and being a part of, this trend in the years to come.</p>\r\n",

    "title": "Investing in FinTech",
    "text": "<p>Last week, we published our first original content in an article titled, &ldquo;<a href=\"/blog/what-is-fintech/\">What is FinTech?</a>&rdquo;. Our goal was to shed some light on how we define the FinTech ecosystem and shape the conversation around FinTech at Wharton and beyond. Over the next few weeks, we&rsquo;re going to dive deeper into different industry verticals and competencies beginning with a focused look at investing in FinTech. At first glance, this might seem like a more nuanced area of focus reserved only for venture capitalists (VCs). However, since online lending and crowd-funding platforms have opened up opportunities for non-bank and non-VCs to lend to companies, coupled with the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Flending-club-files-for-initial-public-offering-1409166093&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE28Mc3EpokqCYzGopgwuGyNgFyIA\">recent announcement</a> that <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lendingclub.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8JE38hlXQsGVF-qwNVPSChjPVjw\">Lending Club</a> has filed for an initial public offering (IPO), the investment horizon for the FinTech industry is poised to grow and change in previously unimaginable ways.</p>\r\n<p>Historically, investing in public companies by buying and selling shares of a firm on a stock market has been relatively easy, at least in the US. However, private companies have often had to resort to other funding sources including VCs, angel investors or friends and family because no public marketplaces existed for them to raise capital. A private transaction would have to be agreed upon by the buyer and seller, which presumes some familiarity with the financial viability of the company. However, with the proliferation of the internet, there is now a wealth of financial information for public and private companies alike and an opportunity for retail investors exists like never before.</p>\r\n<p>Crowdfunding emerged in the early 2000s as a novel way to source capital and invest in ideas using the internet. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freedman-chicago.com%2Fec4i%2FHistory-of-Crowdfunding.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcRIBI3jg4WShRIHz90EfwRwQnuA\">A Brief History of Crowdfunding</a> cites ArtistShare (a website that allowed artists to seek donations in exchange for their digital music) as the first crowdfunding platform with its first user raising nearly $130,000 for an album that later went on to win a Grammy Award in 2005. The relatively quick adoption and success in the crowdfunding space made room for innovation in other forms of online lending. Lending Club and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prosper.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsFeOEtS1PcFyApphHxt8Y46yvug\">Prosper</a> are often <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2012%2F05%2F29%2Fpeer-to-peer-lending-crosses-1-billion-in-loans-issued%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFq60ar0Rpk35tk0Y0vU6aMwCetiw\">credited</a> with beginning the modern peer-to-peer (P2P) lending movement in the United States and since its formation in 2006 Prosper has issued more than $1B of loans between more than 2 million people, transforming the way that people invest.</p>\r\n<p>A closer look at the Lending Club IPO might suggest a windfall for the FinTech Industry. According to their website, Lending club has financed over $5B worth of loans as of the end of 2Q 2014, with nearly 85% used to refinance existing loans (60.95%) or pay off credit cards (22.47%), as reported by borrowers. In its well-circulated white paper &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foundationcapital.com%2Fdownloads%2FFoundationCap_MarketplaceLendingWhitepaper.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFurtFcrS8b78oQAiR3JLl1KcZDbg\">A Trillion Dollar Market By the People, For the People</a>&rdquo;, Foundation Capital, a Silicon Valley VC firm with FinTech portfolio companies that include: Lending Club, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.motifinvesting.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHju5AMZuj7_AED6sU0drDd0Q21FQ\">Motif Investing</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ondeck.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE35teTjj8XNsbxgh-WJ-mPyhF1qg\">OnDeck</a> estimate that &ldquo;banks, credit cards and other lending institutions generate $870B+ each year in fees and interest from over $3.2T in lending activity.&rdquo; To put those numbers into context, the white paper claims that marketplace lending could be bigger than the automobile and airline industries, combined.</p>\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not all about marketplace lending to peers or small businesses, and it&rsquo;s not all happening in Silicon Valley. In their weekly recap of FinTech funding and investments, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.finovate.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgPWfkWY7ExGMrTXedKZKuZvv0EA\">Finovate</a> noted that in the first week of September 2014 &ldquo;19 fintech firms attracted $269 million in new funding&rdquo;, which included an equity trading platform (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iextrading.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHA7BNsm7wDev7toxImXMn5P4OAmQ\">IEX</a>), a Chinese technology platform for underwriting (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wecash.net&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFd7T8Pnn94alAj3fY9732V9rIWNQ\">Wecash</a>), and technology for distributing shareholder information (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediantonline.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFn87FOI3M0SEf09O41Fh_2YvGU5g\">Mediant Communications</a>). In a recent report entitled &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2FMicrosites%2Ffsinsights%2Fcapital-markets-uk%2FDocuments%2FAccenture-Global-Boom-in-Fintech-Investment.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1aNL_XC5eI_Agnlal7uUIsD3ahQ\">The Boom in Global Fintech Investment</a>&rdquo;, Accenture indicates that &ldquo;global investment in financial technology ventures has more than tripled&rdquo; from 2008 to 2013 to nearly $3B and between the UK and Ireland the &ldquo;five-year compound growth rate for fintech financing was twice the global average and twice that of Silicon Valley.&rdquo; Furthermore, Accenture analyzes the growth rate in investments and deal flow between New York City and Silicon Valley in &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpfnyc.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F06%2FNY-FinTech-Report-2014.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhnVg3Ua9vGdKwQ6hF51imx-O61Q\">The Rise of Fintech - New York&#39;s Opportunity for Tech Leadership</a>&rdquo;. Since 2008, NYC has seen a 45% compounded growth rate in investments and a 31% increase in deal flow compared to 23% and 13%, respectively, in Silicon Valley. Accenture estimates that if current trends in financial regulation, consumer demand and innovation continue, investments in global FinTech could reach $8B by 2018.</p>\r\n<p>If past performance is any predictor of future success, then the near and long-term future of the FinTech industry appears extraordinarily promising. The Wharton FinTech Club is excited to be a part of this movement and we will continue to share and promote ideas for innovation and investment in the FinTech space.</p>\r\n",

    "title": "Wealth Advisory 2.0",
    "text": "<p class=\"lead\">Online platforms are making it easier to invest your money. But are they making it better?</p>\r\n<p>What a difference a couple of years makes. Perhaps no other part of the FinTech industry has made more progress in the last 24 months than online wealth management. Where once there were none, now there are many. Where once there was little investment, now it seems like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kitces.com%2Fblog%2Fis-there-a-robo-advisor-bubble-wealthfront-betterment-learnvest-raise-95m-in-capital-in-two-weeks%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhrzm8WNJfbH6MXBMS1FJc9RsgSg\">VCs can&rsquo;t get enough</a>.

Since launching in December 2011, they recently <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wealthfront.com%2Fone-billion&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJBT-yK-Sn68ZeaYqm4bxK6WVbpg\">reached $1 billion </a>in AUM, years faster than other previous market innovators like Vanguard or Charles Schwab.</p>\r\n<p>Estimates vary on the total number of Americans using these platforms, but it&rsquo;s safe to say there is a real groundswell occurring and it&rsquo;s hard to envision anything that would cause it to relent. You know you&rsquo;ve reached an inflection point when all the offline service providers want to do is bash you. So has been the case recently. You can&rsquo;t talk to a registered investment advisor (RIA) for more than a few minutes these days without words like &ldquo;robo-advisor&rdquo; being tossed around pejoratively.</p>\r\n<p>Here we break down the major players in the market and see what they&rsquo;re collectively doing well and where they still need to improve.</p>\r\n<h3>The Market Landscape</h3>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th></th>\r\n      <th>Total Investment</th>\r\n      <th>Distinguishing Factors</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr><td><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnvest.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVnAzcmbFFV_QBWKTgQU3U13ikJg\">LearnVest</a></p></td><td><p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchbase.com%2Forganization%2Flearnvest&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVizWm8QA2lLgeIY9xre5hNrkabw\">$69 million</a></p></td><td><ul><li>Was originally focused on providing advice to women, but is now gender agnostic.</li><li>The company uses a 7 step plan to get your entire financial picture in order.

Advisory fees for traditional advisors often range between 0.5%-2.0%. These new players are much less expensive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Empower investors with an intuitive UI/UX:</strong> As recently as five or ten years ago, managing your finances involved a sea of prospectuses, paper statements, and confusing in-person meetings with your advisor.</p>\r\n<p>These firms are changing all that using design and technology. They&rsquo;re rooting out complexity from a market and helping you understand how your money is being invested.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Data and Transparency:</strong> Ask your traditional advisor what their one, three, five or ten year performance has been and you probably won&rsquo;t get a quick answer. These new companies are making it crystal clear how well they do and how much of your money they make along the way. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Using Behavioral Finance:</strong> Getting people to save more and invest responsibly is often more of a psychology challenge than anything. These companies, notably <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.betterment.com%2Fblog%2Ftags%2Fbehavioral-finance%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_O5l6nTRb-TLBEylxN-1T8jWxKQ\">Betterment</a>, are using behavioral finance to nudge users into more cost effective and sustainable habits.</p>\r\n<h3>How They&rsquo;ll Have To Improve</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Establish more trust and credibility:</strong> The leading companies have already made great strides to build consumers&rsquo; trust, but there&rsquo;s certainly more work to be done. Wealthfront&rsquo;s strategy involves featuring famous investor Burton Malkiel prominently on their website and in press releases. They also show customers from leading tech companies on their homepage as a form of social proof.</p>\r\n<p>Personal Capital&rsquo;s approach is slightly different. Their CEO, Bill Harris, has been prominent in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.financial-planning.com%2Ffp_issues%2F44_01%2Fhigh-tech-invader-to-compete-with-advisors-2687607-1.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvJN0SHjoeA9CodxfgsKGdiuRoqA\">giving interviews</a> and appearing at conferences. The approach they seem to be using is casting themselves as a hybrid between humans and machines. Their vision appears to be to develop a tech-enabled solution that can be tailored by real advisors, rather than a solution that is built strictly around algorithms. Personal Capital also likes to talk about its custodial arrangement with Pershing Advisor Solutions (a subsidiary of BNYMellon), which is still much more of a household name than Personal Capital. </p>\r\n<p>Crossing the chasm and going more into the mainstream will involve building even more trust amongst average Americans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Become full suite solutions:</strong> Asset classes beyond stocks and bonds are mostly outside the scope of the current market participants. Expanding beyond the existing asset classes is almost certainly part of the product roadmap, but questions remain about how quickly and effectively these companies will be able to do that.</p>\r\n<p>For example, these platforms don&rsquo;t currently offer insurance products like life insurance or annuities. Investments and insurance are an artificial distinction and the online wealth advisors have an opportunity to create comprehensive solutions and better outcomes for consumers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Allow for More Customization:</strong> What many of these companies will tell you today is that once you tell them the basics like your age and risk appetite, they know the best asset mix for you. There&rsquo;s some truth to it, but many consumers also get uncomfortable when they&rsquo;re told they have to follow what feels like a one-size-fits-all approach. These firms make higher margins if they can push people into fewer profiles, but it may be at the expense of expanding market share and really entering the mainstream.</p>\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>As these online wealth advisors become even more sophisticated, they will continue to take market share for years to come. In many ways, these startups have the possibility to not only lower costs, but also improve upon the experience and use data to drive better advice. </p>\r\n<p>Current target customers might be just millennials and tech company employees, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how these solutions won&rsquo;t be catering to the masses in the very near future.</p>\r\n<p>Ready. Set. Invest!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I am a Personal Capital customer and a happy one at that.</p>\r\n",

Their index is much more rigorous than our small sampling allows us to be, so comparing our popularity to the TIOBE index is not a fair, apples-to-apples comparison. However, TIOBE reports this September that Java and C++ are at an all-time low:</p>\r\n<blockquote><small>Java and C++ are at an all time low in the TIOBE index since its start in the year 2001. This doesn't necessarily mean that Java and C++ are on their way out. There is still a huge demand for these programming languages. A possible explanation for this trend is that the notion of programming has widened its scope through the years. A growing number of specific fields is using programming languages to write programs nowadays. Examples are biomedical, statistical, hardware and psychological programming. These specific fields all come with their own set of programming languages that are gaining ground at the expense of general purpose languages such as Java and C++.</small></blockquote>\r\n<h2 id=\"where-is-this-going-\">Where is this going?</h2>\r\n<p>This is our first observation, and we at the Wharton FinTech Club will watch these numbers in coming months and years to see what trends evolve. Our hypothesis is that FinTech will follow the trend in the broader industry and move away from the general purpose languages (such as Java) and towards languages more conducive for statistical analysis (such as Python). A lot of attention is paid to the business of FinTech but it is technology itself that drives this impact. We\u2019re excited to see how this landscape evolves in the coming years and whether innovation in FinTech will drive adoption in the broader technology sphere.</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"we-want-to-hear-from-you\">We want to hear from you</h2>\r\n<p>Are you an innovator in financial technology?

    "description": "FinTech goes hand-in-hand with Social Impact, i.e., positive change for a society beyond the economic value that accrues to a firm's employees, shareholders and creditors.",
    "title": "FinTech and Social Impact",
    "text": "<h2>Diverse Perspectives</h2>\r\n<p>Since launching WFTC last month, I have had the privilege of meeting many classmates who have backgrounds and interests in FinTech. Even within the relatively specialized industry of financial technology, everyone has a different perspective and unique goal for what they want to get out of their work with the club. Some people are interested in payments, others in lending. We have members who have worked for or with startups in the personal wealth management space or the big firms in the credit card space, among other things.</p>\r\n<h2>Social Impact</h2>\r\n<p>One thread that keeps on coming up during these discussions spirals around the nebulous domain of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact\">social impact</a>. By this I mean the ability of an entity or endeavor to make a positive change for a society beyond the economic value that accrues to its employees, shareholders and creditors (and the government to which it pays taxes). A related term, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_investing\">impact investing</a>, is defined by the <a href=\"http://www.thegiin.org/cgi-bin/iowa/aboutus/index.html\">Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN)</a> as \"...investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. Impact investments can be made in both emerging and developed markets, and target a range of returns from below-market to above-market rates, depending upon the circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>On reflection, it isn't a huge surprise that so many of my classmates share an interest in social impact and impact investing, in particular. The Wharton School is home to the <a href=\"http://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/\">Wharton Social Impact initiative (WSII)</a>, an organization at the forefront of research on social impact and the practical applications of the practices it entails. In short, there is probably some selection bias in the sample of people that I call classmates when it comes to this topic. And given Wharton's unrivaled pedigree for finance among business schools, it makes sense that we should find a healthy cohort of students with interests in both of these domains.</p>\r\n<h2>Philosophy</h2>\r\n<p>The intersection of FinTech and social impact is particularly relevant when one considers the arguments that are often made for the social value of financiers and those working in financial markets. The broad strokes are that well-functioning capital markets allocate capital in such a way as to maximize economic potential for societies at large. Therefore, pursuing a career in banking or investment management can be a morally righteous endeavor because allocating capital and providing liquidity are economic valuable activities. Now, this argument presupposes that the people performing these roles are doing their jobs effectively and that any economic value that is generated isn't captured by a select number of economic entities, rather than society as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>I am not going to argue that I, and my many friends who have worked in finance in the past, present and future, were not economically valuable. However, I would accept the argument that the current global financial system provides sub-optimal outcomes for the majority of our fellow human beings. I would posit that this is due primarily to two factors: first, that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics\">the human brain is not adapted to making financial decisions</a>; and second, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_policies_and_the_subprime_mortgage_crisis\">artificial market distortions imposed by governments</a>. The first of these is something that those who build and deploy financial technology have been working on some time on the consumer side of the market, where companies like <a href=\"https://www.learnvest.com/\">LearnVest</a> are giving people the knowledge and tools to make better financial decision. I think there may be bigger opportunities in the B2B realm, where bureaucratic inertia and government regulation create disincentives to adopt new technology. That said, I am too pessimistic to claim that similar potential exists in B2G at the moment, where inertia and regulatory hurdles are much bigger roadblocks.</p>\r\n<h2>The Future</h2>\r\n<p>Because financial technology enables the actors in capital markets and financial systems to operate more efficiently and make better decisions there is a clearly delineated link between FinTech and social impact. Companies like <a href=\"https://commonbond.co/\">CommonBond</a> are lowering interest rates on student loans by leveraging P2P technology to connect student borrowers with alumni lenders, and <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/social_sector/mobile_money_getting_to_scale_in_emerging_markets\">mobile banking platforms</a> are bringing financial services to millions of people in emerging markets by leapfrogging the traditional economic entities upon which developed financial systems are built. In essence, the application of technology to finance imposes an ethos of innovation on the financial industry, i.e., how do we solve the problems that users of the world's financial systems are facing? As smaller, nimbler companies are able to successfully navigate the regulatory and competitive landscapes of their respective verticals, they will force the bigger companies to reconsider their focus from protecting market positions to re-discovering and catering to customers needs. If they don't, the big firms won't be so big for very long.</p>\r\n<p>From the perspective of an MBA student who is searching for a career that will make a positive impact on society, FinTech is an industry that makes a lot of sense, particularly for those of us focused on recruiting for early-stage companies. Many of my classmates have extensive experience working for financial institutions which gives them an excellent foundation upon which to develop their technical understanding (essentially, they have the \u201cFin\u201d, but they need more experience with the \u201cTech\u201d). Additionally, many of the opportunities in FinTech lie in the B2B channels, where an MBA can bring clear value to a startup right away; this value proposition is often less obvious for early-stage tech companies focused on the consumer or that lie in other industries. Using technology, financial institutions can provide billions of people with access to capital and enable them to make better personal and professional financial decisions. This impact is tangible and could be the positive influence that many of my fellow students are looking to have when they graduate from Wharton.</p>\r\n<h2>In short</h2>\r\n<p>Having a career that is both personally rewarding and makes a meaningful positive difference in the lives of others is a worthy goal. <a href=\"http://whartonsocialventurefund.org/\">Social impact ventures</a> and the companies that invest in them are providing channels for professionals to realize this duality. Working in the FinTech industry is one of the best ways for socially-conscious MBAs to start a career or launch a company. I am proud of the members of the Wharton FinTech Club for seeing finance, and the technology that drives it, as avenues to improve the lives of their fellow human beings. I hope that we can collectively play a part in making an impact on our societies by developing and deploying technology to make financial systems more efficient.</p>\r\n",

    "title": "Wharton FinTech in DC",
    "text": "<p>Last night we had the privilege to attend a launch reception to kick off the Milken Institute Center for Financial Markets\u2019 newest program, FinTech: 21st Century Market and Policy Developments. The purpose of the initiative is to analyze the impact of financial technologies on markets and market structure, and explore policy frameworks that encourage responsible development of financial technology. Covered topics include digital and electronic currencies, digital payments, online finance platforms and data in risk analytics. Key stakeholders from across the FinTech landscape, including policymakers, regulators, academics, legal professionals and market participants, came together at the St. Regis Hotel in Washington, DC to hear about the work that CFM is doing in FinTech and learn more about where the space is going from a policy and industry perspective.</p>\r\n<h2>Milken and CFM</h2>\r\n<p>By way of introduction, <a href=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/\">The Milken Institute</a> is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank that believes in the power of capital markets to solve urgent social and economic challenges and improve lives. Its mission is \u201cto improve lives around the world by advancing innovative economic and policy solutions that create jobs, widen access to capital and enhance health.\u201d More specifically, <a href=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/centers/markets/\">The Center for Financial Markets</a> promotes the understanding of global markets and financial solutions that seek to solve the global challenges. For those of you following the work we have been doing at Wharton FinTech and the mission of the club, much of this should sound familiar.</p>\r\n<h2>The Industry</h2>\r\n<p>The informational portion of the event began with an introduction delivered by Staci Warden, Executive Director of CFM, which set the stage for an evening of education, idea sharing and spirited discussion between a diverse group of people looking to understand and promote disruptive technological solutions for financial services and capital markets.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Chris Brummer, a Senior Fellow at the Milken Institute and Professor of Law at Georgetown University, and Daniel Gorfine, Director of Financial Markets Policy and Legal Counsel for CFM, mapped the growth and proliferation of FinTech innovation and identified four main distinct verticals in the space: Digital and Electronic Currencies, Digital Payment Systems, Online Finance and Investment Platforms, and Big Data. These industry segments demonstrated common disruptive characteristics that warrant creative approaches to regulation, including the disintermediation of existing participants, the convergence of the financial and technological industries, lower costs and reduced barriers to entry, borderless platforms that create a singular global marketplace and democratizing financial inclusion.</p>\r\n<h2>Policy and Regulation</h2>\r\n<p>The presentation continued by discussing a comprehensive approach to principles, processes and rules for FinTech and capital market regulation, and discussed a \u201cprinciples-based\u201d regulation model that could offer potential benefits to markets and market participants as the industry matures in order to encourage best practices and prohibit negative behavior. Brummer and Gorfine compared and contrasted the merits of highly prescriptive regulation with a principled approach for rulemaking. They discussed a new paradigm for agile and iterative rulemaking that leverages the flexibility and speed of industry innovation, experimentation with pilots and trials, and engagement versus enforcement strategies in order to enhance communication while mitigating risk-taking and introducing judicial and adjudicatory review processes. Lastly, Brummer and Gorfine discussed the risks inherent in a rapidly changing regulatory environment, namely the lack of foresight and clarity for market participants operating in the legal environment created by such regulation. </p>\r\n<h2>Connecting</h2>\r\n<p>At the conclusion of the formal presentations, we had the chance to ask questions of the panel and everyone had plenty of time to discuss the questions and ideas we had just heard. We stuck around to discuss these issues with the regulators, lawyers, investors, policy makers and managers in attendance, engaging with a surprisingly diverse set of perspectives and opinions. Of course, we also got to talk about the Wharton FinTech platform and identify potential partners for the initiatives we are working on.</p>\r\n<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\r\n<p>The Center for Financial Markets and the Milken Institute have several future engagements planned to support their FinTech program and existing initiatives. These events range from regularly recurring FinTech industry leadership panels, to the Institute\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/conferences/summit/london-2014/\">London Summit</a> on October 28, 2014, and culminate with the <a href=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/conferences/global-conference/global-conference-2015/\">Global Conference</a> in late April 2015 in Los Angeles. Wharton FinTech and the Milken Institute share many of the same goals and we are thrilled to have had the chance to engage with them on these issues. Over the coming months we expect to deliver education and opportunities to connect to the Milken Institute and the rest of the FinTech industry.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Daniel considers the risks that a dynamic financial services regulatory environment introduces, suggesting that this paradigm of regulation can be modeled as a dynamical system.",
    "title": "FinTech, Regulation and Chaos",
    "text": "<h3>Genesis</h3>\r\n<p>A couple of weeks ago I attended a launch reception to kick off the Milken Institute Center for Financial Markets\u2019 newest program, FinTech: 21st Century Market and Policy Developments (check out my <a href=\"http://www.danielmcauley.com/wharton-fintech-in-dc/\">blog post</a> on the event for more details). This was the first policy-focused event I had attended on behalf of Wharton FinTech and there were a number of engaged and interesting stakeholders there who offered some really unique insights into their respective niches in the FinTech landscape.</p>\r\n<p>One of these interesting people was Dr. Chris Brummer, a Senior Fellow at the Milken Institute and Professor of Law at Georgetown University. Dr. Brummer was a speaker at the event and, as I mentioned in my previous post, his presentation discussed a \u201cprinciples-based\u201d regulation model that could offer potential benefits to markets and market participants as the FinTech industry matures in order to encourage best practices and prohibit negative behavior. Brummer and his co-presenter, Daniel Gorfine, Director of Financial Markets Policy and Legal Counsel for CFM, compared and contrasted the merits of highly prescriptive regulation with a principled approach for rulemaking. They discussed a new paradigm for agile and iterative rulemaking that leverages the flexibility and speed of industry innovation, experimentation with pilots and trials, and engagement versus enforcement strategies. Lastly, Brummer and Gorfine discussed the risks inherent in a rapidly changing regulatory environment, namely the lack of foresight and clarity for market participants operating in the legal environment created by such regulation.</p>\r\n<p>After the presentation was over I spoke with Dr. Brummer about the risks he mentioned that a dynamic regulatory environment introduces. Specifically, I suggested that the paradigm of regulation he was suggesting could be modeled as a dynamical system.</p>\r\n<h3>Math</h3>\r\n<p>For those of you that are not familiar with dynamical systems check out the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system\">Wikipedia definition</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>A dynamical system is a concept in mathematics where a fixed rule describes how a point in a geometrical space depends on time. Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The field of dynamical systems has developed models and discovered properties of systems in domains from biology to economics to physics. When a dynamical system exhibits relationships between states that are nonlinear it is referred to as \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory\">chaotic</a>\". One interesting and important property of chaotic systems is that even though they are deterministic they are still unpredictable. This means that even if you model a chaotic system using some set of deterministic rules you can't predict the state of that model (and hence the system) at any point in the future without iterating through all states antecedent to that point.</p>\r\n<h3>Chaos</h3>\r\n<p>Chaos typically arises when feedback loops exacerbate the current state of a given system. In the case of an agile, i.e., responsive, system of regulation and public policy there are a number of ways in which such feedback loops might arise. Perhaps an agile regulatory framework provides too little clarity for industry and so investment declines which forces regulators to respond with changes. These changes further increase the malleability of the regulatory framework thereby inducing further reductions in investment. Or maybe regulators pick metrics against which to benchmark the efficacy of a given policy that don't take into account the systemic risk that responses from industry create. This would incentivize risk-generating behavior on the part of industry, which would ostensibly drive further regulatory changes and so on and so forth. All the while, systemic risk would build up and acceleration in the frequency and severity of economically significant negative events would occur.</p>\r\n<p>Let me clear, this is all conjecture. That said, an agile regulatory paradigm needs to be thought about very, very hard before it is implemented. Maybe such a system is might be dynamical but non-chaotic. Perhaps there are negative feedback effects that constrain the negative potentialities I am considering. Regardless, we need to evaluate available analogues and understand the impact that dynamic regulation has on industry, the economy and policy. In an attempt to start this process, I highlight a few pieces of research I came across after search Google Scholar below.</p>\r\n<h3>Literature</h3>\r\n<p>It appears that the paradigm of regulation and industry as a dynamical system has existed in the domains of economics and law for a couple of decades. While I didn't find a tremendous amount of literature there is some precedent for approaching the questions this framework implies.</p>\r\n<p>A paper by J. B. Ruhl in the March issue of the Duke Law Journal, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1372975?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104275069951\">Complexity Theory as a Paradigm for the Dynamical Law-and-Society System</a>, examines the interaction of law and <em>society</em> as a nonlinear dynamical system and discusses freedoms, rights and regulations as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor\">attractors</a> in this model.</p>\r\n<p>A piece from the EASST Review by Henry Etzkowitz and Loet Leydesdorff, <a href=\"http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/935\">The Triple Helix: University - Industry - Government Relations</a>, looks at the three-body problem of Government, Industry and Academia and asks whether this \"triple-helix\" is a nonlinear dynamical system. In fact, the piece asks a lot of question but doesn't provide too much to work with in terms of answers.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, I found a book by Kurt dopfer, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Dr6I-jZ5ER4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=public+policy+%22dynamical+system%22&amp;ots=_0kY3KDqaT&amp;sig=eM6mh1VFynIqfQjR2Pivbye8NXE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">The Evolutionary Foundations of Economics</a>, that \"...brings together fifteen original articles from scholars - each of whom has made a significant contribution to the field - in their common effort to reconstruct economics as an evolutionary science.\" One piece in the book by Paul A. David, \"Path dependence in economics processes: implications for policy analysis in dynamical system contexts\", is particularly poignant in that it explicitly discusses the path dependent nature of economic systems and the nonlinear dynamics that arise from this property. However, it is more focused on the economic system itself as dynamical, rather that the system of industry and regulation together. That said, this paper is over a decade old and I imagine I will find some more recent work that more closely addresses the questions I am pondering.</p>\r\n<h3>Thoughts</h3>\r\n<p>I'm only beginning to think about the impact of public policy on FinTech but it is something that I and members of Wharton FinTech care about. The available research is not a body of literature I am familiar with and there are surely other papers out there. Furthermore, it would be great to expose research in this field to the members of the club, practitioners and others on the policy side. If there is a way to facilitate this let's discuss.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Danielle talks about the ways that LendUp is helping increase financial literacy, incentivizing financial education and disrupting the payday loan industry.",
    "title": "How LendUp Is Incentivizing Financial Education",
    "text": "<p>FinTech has the potential to change consumer behavior for the better, if there are incentives to do so. Over two years ago, I helped start an online loan company called <a href=\"http://www.lendup.com\">LendUp</a>, which uses technology to offer customers a transparent, lower fee loan with the ability to build credit. We started LendUp because we knew technology could help us broaden our reach and through design we wanted to create a better product to help get consumers out of the payday debt trap. Recently, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling <a href=\"http://www.nfcc.org/newsroom/FinancialLiteracy/files2013/NFCC_2014%20FinancialLiteracySurvey_FINAL.pdf\">reported</a> that 75% of American families said that they live paycheck to paycheck and more than 25% of American families have no savings at all. It is hard to change behavior if you don\u2019t understand personal finance basics, so we created a credit education platform within our website to incentivize customers to take credit education courses. </p>\r\n<h2 id=\"how-does-lendup-incentivize-financial-education\">How Does Lendup Incentivize Financial Education?</h2>\r\n<p>When thinking about personal finance, what you don\u2019t know can cost you money. <a href=\"http://www.nfcc.org/newsroom/FinancialLiteracy/files2013/NFCC_2014%20FinancialLiteracySurvey_FINAL.pdf\">It has been reported</a> that 21% of Americans admitted that they do not know what credit is and how it impacts them. We wanted to educate our customers, but we knew we needed to incentivize them to learn. At LendUp, our business model is based around repayment - we don\u2019t make money unless the customer pays us back, which is contrary to what <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/multimedia/data-visualizations/2014/key-findings-about-internet-payday-lending\">our competitors</a> have been doing in the past. We call our financial education video platform, \"LendUp\u2019s credit education series\", since we deal with lending a line of credit to customers. With the <a href=\"http://www.lendup.com/ladder\">LendUp Ladder program</a>, each time a customer pays back a loan on-time they earn points. Those points add up to give users eventual access to higher dollar, lower fee loans in the future and have the ability to report their repayment history to the major credit bureaus. When a user watches our credit education videos and takes all the quizzes, they earn the same amount of points they would for paying back a loan on-time. For those who have recently declared bankruptcy and others who have subprime credit and  want to rebuild their credit but don\u2019t know where to start. LendUp is the solution. </p>\r\n<p>These credit education courses directly address aspects of a customer\u2019s outstanding loan and they can learn about the importance of paying on-time with the points incentive. We spent months researching other education programs, gathering feedback from thousands of customers and working with experts in the education field to create these courses. We offer these videos for free to customers and the public on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYNz3RS91VI&amp;list=PL6Kj6lh9r-a6m5AXS8ojUx9T_iB0R2FXx\">YouTube </a>and on <a href=\"http://www.lendup.com/credit-education\">our website</a> but we didn\u2019t stop there. After we created our credit education series we realized that there were still questions that our customers consistently asked and we wanted to address those issues as well. So, we created <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmr1J-XY49s&amp;list=PL6Kj6lh9r-a6QoQKug-dM-G92YK1FeV4W\">LendUp\u2019s Fast Financial Facts YouTube videos</a> to address common financial questions in under a minute. Now borrowers can quickly get the answers they want.</p>\r\n<p>Recently we gathered statistics about borrower engagement and found that one in four of all our customers take our credit education courses. The customers who complete our credit education series have a 20% higher repayment rate compared to those that do not take the courses. While we won\u2019t remove education from some of our customers to test definitive proof of causation versus correlation, we do see it driving business value in repayment. We are currently operating in 16 states (and growing) so let\u2019s compare that to national averages about financial education. <a href=\"http://www.nfcc.org/newsroom/FinancialLiteracy/files2013/NFCC_2014%20FinancialLiteracySurvey_FINAL.pdf\">Reports indicate</a> that one in three adults admit to having little to no knowledge of financial education. Not only do consumers have answers to the tricks and traps the credit game can reveal, but they are also given tips on how to solve those financial problems they regularly face. In addition, we allow customers to access LendUp 24/7 from any device. You can use a computer, tablet or smartphone to log into your account to check the status of your loan or take the credit education courses.</p>\r\n<p>Incentivizing financial education is a win-win for both customers and the economy. <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/investing/fdic-study-outrageous-overdraft-fees-1.aspx#ixzz3Bc5OsT3v%20\">A 2007 study by the Center for Responsible Lending</a> said consumers are paying $17.5 billion annually in fees alone. This money could have been saved and used for other things like buying a house, a car, or investing in a college education, which in turn could broaden the tax base rather and possibly revitalize<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/imf-cuts-u-s-2014-growth-forecast-to-2-1402925865\"> our strained</a><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/imf-cuts-u-s-2014-growth-forecast-to-2-1402925865\"> economy</a>. If a customer has the tools to understand the financial situations they are getting into, they will be better equipped to make decisions in the future and possibly avoid defaulting on payments or overdrafting a bank account. </p>\r\n<p>I encourage FinTech companies to work with policy makers like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help Americans get out of debt. However, until incumbent financial institutions provide real incentives to do so, FinTech can pave the way. Within this space there are several opportunities to create market solutions for real-world problems and at LendUp we are seeing positive results. We hope this will have a ripple effect throughout the country and cause politicians, financial institutions and startups to rethink how they can best create real solutions to the financial problems Americans face everyday.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Sasha discusses his views on the rapidly growing peer-to-peer (P2P) lending industry, including the competitive landscape, benefits and risks of investing and future impact.",
    "title": "P2P Lending: Industry Overview",
    "text": "<p>On campus, in the office and on the Street, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending has <a href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/public/in-the-news.action\">soared in popularity over the last few years</a>. I became professionally and financially engaged with the P2P lending space while working for American Express\u2019s OPEN Small Business team and it has been thrilling to watch the industry grow and develop. I recently hosted a seminar on P2P lending on behalf of Wharton FinTech and wanted to highlight a few insights and analyses.</p>\r\n<p>P2P lending is the practice of loaning money to individuals through a simple online platform. These online platforms connect lenders (also known as investors) to borrowers and cut out traditional financial institutions. Borrowers seek to receive a lump-sum loan from investors which is then typically used to refinance credit card debt, consolidate loans or meet other financial obligations. Though loan sizes can vary from as little as $5,000 to as much as $250,000 (depending on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness and desired use of capital), the average loan size is roughly $15,000. Annual Percentage Rates (APR) range from around 7-36%, and loan terms are generally for either three or five years. The actual loan product is cut up into small fragments (e.g. a $10,000 loan can be cut up into $25 \u201cnotes\u201d), which are then purchased by investors. The P2P lending platform facilitates interest and principal payments from borrowers to investors, and makes money by taking a small percentage of the payment, usually in addition to an origination fee off the loan. It\u2019s clear that the P2P lending model is a proven and effective alternative to borrowing money directly from a bank and appeals to participants by offering a streamlined application and rapid credit-decisioning process.</p>\r\n<h2>Landscape: Who\u2019s Who in P2P Lending?</h2>\r\n<p>In order to properly assess the P2P lending landscape, it is important to recognize the key players. Prosper and Lending Club are the largest and most well-established incumbents in the US market. Founded in 2005 and 2006, respectively, these two platforms have issued over $6B in loans to date and own the <a href=\"http://www.siliconbeat.com/2014/07/08/lending-club-loans-exceed-5-billion/\">lion\u2019s share of the current P2P market</a>; however, Lending Club is substantially larger than Prosper in terms of overall loan issuance volume. Lending Club is also the first P2P platform to announce that it intends to go public and was valued at roughly $4B earlier this year after <a href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/public/images/0ee673f/content/press/pdf/Financial_Times_04.17.14.pdf\">acquiring Springstone, a patient financing company</a>. However, Lending Club has yet to show consistent profitability <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/lending-club-files-for-initial-public-offering-1409166093\">(posting a net loss for the first half of 2014)</a>, and this valuation feels very much dependent on the company\u2019s ability to continue growing at a rapid pace. Outside the US, UK-based Zopa is the largest P2P lending platform, having facilitated over \u00a3650M in loans.</p>\r\n<p>Over the past few years we\u2019ve seen a rapid increase in the number of new competitors and product offerings. Some entrants, such as Funding Circle, have established themselves in the small business loan space, while CommonBond and SoFi have targeted student loans - specifically those offered to MBA students. However, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor\">these platforms have largely restricted investment opportunities to accredited investors</a>. Other new players, such as <a href=\"http://www.pave.com/\">Pave</a> and <a href=\"https://www.upstart.com/\">Upstart</a>, are looking to break into the P2P space by underwriting loan applicants with sparser credit histories. Wharton FinTech had the chance to speak with Pave\u2019s co-founder, Oren Bass, and head of Business Development, Kathryn Ebner:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>\u201dP2P lending is evolving \u2013 everyone\u2019s been focused on pricing and rates, which are key components, but what we haven\u2019t yet seen is a holistic approach.  At Pave, we believe that the rate is just one part of the experience. We want to provide a funding product that enables the success of the future generation.</p>\r\n  <p>Our underwriting model goes beyond FICO to help us better understand each borrower's financial situation so that we can personalize each loan decision.  Our borrowers often use the funds in a way to further their education or enhance their career or financial stability - you can use the funds to take a course at a coding bootcamp, relocate to a new city for an exciting job offer or even refinance your credit card debt at better rates. To empower our borrowers even further, our loans have a flexible payment structure where you can choose when to begin making payments, either 3 or 6 months after receiving funds, which is especially important for those taking educational courses. Ultimately, we believe our users want their money from a brand they trust and that understands their needs beyond just a financial relationship. We're more than just a loan.\u201d</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We also spoke with Brigitte Bradford of Upstart\u2019s marketing team:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>\u201cUpstart is a marketplace lending platform that goes beyond the FICO score to finance people based on signals of their potential, including schools attended, area of study, academic performance and work history. Our proprietary underwriting model identifies high quality borrowers despite limited credit and employment experience.</p>\r\n  <p>While Lending Club and Prosper's innovation has focused on offering better rates by saving on operation costs, we've taken what they've learned and built a better, smarter product. On the borrower side, our dynamic, data-driven underwriting enables us to continually improve and expand our ability to find and serve people who have the ability and propensity to repay loans. On the investor side, unlike Lending Club and Prosper we don't charge investors any fees, and we're the first platform to offer auto-invest to all investors and origination fee refunds on any loan that defaults.\u201d</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Benefits and Risks of Investing</h2>\r\n<p>Should you invest in a P2P loan? Ultimately, that decision comes down to your personal risk tolerance and your existing assets and investment portfolio. The P2P lending industry has the potential to offer attractive return on investment despite uncertainty about this new asset class. First-time investors should always be aware of the benefits and risks of investing. </p>\r\n<p>P2P lending offers a new asset class that may help diversify an existing investment portfolio. <a href=\"https://www.lendingclub.com/info/statistics-performance.action\">Recent returns have been solidly positive (anywhere between 5-15%) and default rates have been low</a>. Additionally, platforms such as Lending Club give investors the flexibility to \u201ccherry-pick\u201d investments notes and provides fairly robust details on a prospective borrower. Conversely, institutional investors may sometimes have right of first refusal for the most attractive loans; this means that retail investors have less variety and potentially less attractive loan candidates to fund, thereby increasing the chance for default and reducing reducing overall returns. </p>\r\n<p>Most importantly, investors should be aware that P2P loans are not collateralized, meaning they are not tied to physical property such as a house or car. If a borrower runs into financial trouble, a P2P loan is likely last in line for repayment. <a href=\"http://the-military-guide.com/2013/06/06/more-problems-with-peer-to-peer-lending/\">Loan performance can also be highly volatile and has been shown to be correlated with overall economic conditions</a>. Finally, the P2P space is sparsely regulated and could be negatively affected by future financial regulation. Investors should carefully weigh all the risk factors prior to investing into P2P lending and apply the same level of due diligence as for any other asset class.</p>\r\n<h2>Impact and Future</h2>\r\n<p>Given the increasing number of entrants and growing general awareness of the space, it\u2019s likely that P2P lending will have a significant impact on the US and international credit industry. What started as a way for individuals to refinance credit card debt has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry that is rippling into student and small business loans. Auto loans and mortgages, though more challenging and competitive, may be next. However, hedge funds and other institutional investors are starting to replace retail investors as the target source of capital for the larger P2P platforms, challenging the notion that P2P lending will truly remain \u201cpeer-to-peer.\u201d It\u2019s also unclear how the large, traditional lenders \u2013 e.g. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America \u2013 will respond, but it\u2019s a safe bet that these banks will act in the near future to stave off further disintermediation. What is clear is that, barring a sudden economic downturn or strong regulation, P2P lending will continue gaining momentum and disrupting the credit industry \u2013 it\u2019s a fascinating time to be involved.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\r\n  <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/40974597\"></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n",

    "description": "Cameron interviews Laura Spiekerman, the Head of Business Development for Knox Payments, a FinTech startup that allows merchants to use ACH to accept payments.",
    "title": "Knox Payments: Bringing ACH Payments to Everyday Life",
    "text": "<p><em>The following is a Q&amp;A excerpt between Wharton FinTech VP of Communications, Cameron Peake, and <a href=\"https://knoxpayments.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Knox Payments</a> Director of Business Development, Laura Spiekerman.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Knox is a payments company focused on delivering fast and more affordable payment processing for merchants.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about Knox, and how you stand out among ACH payment innovators.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Knox was founded by Tommy Nicholas and Thomas Eide. Thomas wanted to start a peer-to-peer (P2P) payments company, and to leverage <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House\">ACH</a> (Automated Clearing House) channels -- the systems that banks commonly use to transfer money. The main benefit of ACH is that it is much cheaper to transfer funds than traditional payment channels such as credit card payment switches (a few cents compared to roughly 3% + up to $0.30 per transaction). However, he quickly found out that user behavior would make ACH adoption challenging: customers needed to remember bank routing numbers and the transactions took multiple days. He did, however, see an opportunity to use the same technology to offer merchant payments.</p>\r\n<p>Knox works with merchants, and enables them to receive ACH payments from customers that aren\u2019t officially affiliated with Knox\u2014customers just need to provide their online banking username and password. This enables Knox, through technology similar to that deployed by Mint.com, to verify the customer has sufficient funds and ability to pay. Knox can then advance the funds to merchants within one business day, offer drastically lower merchant transaction fees, and verify customer ability to pay.</p>\r\n<p>Knox estimates that it interfaces with 23 banks that service roughly 90% of the US banking population, so that nearly any customer appropriate for this service is able to pay through the interface.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What type of merchants are you targeting?</strong></p>\r\n<p>At first, Knox targeted small and medium merchants. Now, we are focusing on scale and looking at two primary tracks:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Large merchants</em> \u2014 they represent the holy grail of payments, but require a big investment and long sales cycle. We're placing some bets here, knowing that if they choose Knox, then we win big.</li>\r\n<li><em>Small but growing companies</em> \u2014 Knox is exploring venture-backed startups that could go big\u2014but are a bet for the company.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Outside of these priority areas, we are also partnering with offline merchants such as doctors. For them, high transaction fees from credit cards can be challenging to manage, and Knox saves them money.</p>\r\n<p><strong>There is clearly a value proposition for merchants, who save money on transaction fees. What\u2019s the value prop for customers, particularly when they are strongly incentivized to use cards?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Knox has focused on segments where our payments interface is either the only electronic payment option or the best option for consumers. For example, we have largely focused on financial services companies: online lenders, prepaid debit, brokerage, billpay, etc. These services very rarely accept credit cards. Over time, we <em>will</em> need to go head-to-head with credit cards, but we believe our service will bring consumer benefits that include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Merchants can offer cash back (e.g. a 1% discount on all purchases made through Knox), given their improved margin over credit cards;</li>\r\n<li>An improved mobile experience, given the speed and ease of entering in information compared to credit cards.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Tell us more about your work with cryptocurrency.</strong></p>\r\n<p>We have a partnership with Ripple Labs, the main provider of <a href=\"https://www.ripplelabs.com/xrp-distribution/\">XRP</a>. Ripple Labs has something they call gateway partners\u2014developers that build on top of their protocol. We are one of their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer\">KYC</a> (know-your-customer, a customer identity verification and fraud prevention process) and cash in/cash out partners.</p>\r\n<p>More recently, we partnered with coinX, which provides back-end support for other companies working in anything money-transition related such as remittances and Bitcoin. Again, we provided KYC and cash in/cash out services.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, just last week we announced partnership with <a href=\"https://www.vogogo.com\">Vogogo</a>. The company provides backend KYC, AML (anti-money laundering) and payments processing tools for Bitcoin exchanges. Knox will be the exclusive payments provider into the US market.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For a startup like Knox, how do you think MBAs can contribute and add value?</strong></p>\r\n<p>At Knox, like many startups, we lack the skills and time to focus on \"professionalization\" of the company. Often sitting down and thinking through long-term strategy is very challenging. Pulling out of the weeds and thinking long-term is an important perspective that MBAs can bring. In addition, thinking through how to professionalize operations is really important and not at the forefront of a startup teams\u2019 minds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What advice do you have about working in a nontechnical role at a startup?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is important to get up to speed! At Knox, being technical does not just mean how to code\u2014it means understanding ACH batches and other payment processing technologies. One thing I did was read a book called <em>Payment Systems in the United States</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Although I may not have all of the technical knowledge, I hear all of the customer feedback, which is also really important. I then relay that to the team so they can understand how to prioritize their time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What's next for Knox?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We\u2019ll continue to explore scaling opportunities, and in particular retail institutions and marketplaces. In addition we\u2019ll raise our Series A in January. A lot of exciting things are ahead!</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Twenty-one members of Wharton FinTech traveled to New York City on our first ever FinTech industry trek. Highlights include visits with Betterment, SecondMarket and Pave.",
    "title": "Silicon Alley and the Growing FinTech Ecosystem in NYC",
    "text": "<p>Last Friday, twenty-one members of Wharton FinTech traveled to New York City on our first ever FinTech industry trek. With attendees from the Wharton MBA and the University of Pennsylvania Management and Technology programs, student interest in the first-ever Wharton FinTech trek exceeded capacity. The trek made five stops in the Silicon Alley area of New York City - a growing hotbed for technology innovation - visiting with FinTech startups and investors.</p>\r\n<p>The first stop was <a href=\"https://www.secondmarket.com/\">SecondMarket</a>\u2019s loft-style office space in the heart of the Silicon Alley. SecondMarket was founded in 2004 as an online marketplace for global institutional and accredited investors to exchange illiquid assets, and is well-known for trading Facebook, Tesla, Zynga and Twitter stock before they went public. SecondMarket was represented by Michael Sonnenshein, from the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a subsidiary of SecondMarket and a rapidly growing business line that is being driven by Barry Silbert, the company\u2019s founder. SecondMarket is poised for some unique changes as it seeks to capture value in the digital currency space, while continuing to grow its core software offerings. We were fortunate to discuss opportunities for MBAs at the company in addition to the future of Bitcoin and other digital currencies and hear what SecondMarket is doing in the space.</p>\r\n<p>The trek continued to the brand-new home of <a href=\"http://www.quarterspot.com\">Quarterspot</a> - a small and medium business (SMB) online lending platform. The discussion was led by Adam Cohen, the co-founder and CEO of Quarterspot who demonstrated the startup\u2019s unique, highly-technical and predictive risk management model that drives executive decision-making. Additionally, Adam - who used to run a startup incubator - provided perspective on how to attract high-performing talent to a nascent company and what it\u2019s like to manage peers in a relatively flat organizational structure. \u201cYou need to find people who have been at a company for a little while [1-2 years] and are tired of being over-promised that they can make a difference. That\u2019s who you want. Don\u2019t manage them, collaborate.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Next we headed over to <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/\">Betterment</a>, the automated investing service that came out of Columbia Business School, who hosted us for lunch and networking with the entire staff (including, of course, the office dog!). We were privileged to join the company\u2019s co-founders, Jon Stein and Eli Broverman, for an intimate Q&amp;A. Jon and Eli waxed poetic about developing a working relationship long before ever deciding to start a business together. We also heard from the founders how business school helped nurture the startup in its nascent days, although at that time many people told them they were tackling too big of a problem. Focusing more on Betterment today, the founders described their vision for MBA and technical hiring, user growth and continued drive to capture market share from traditional players in the space. \u201cWe think this is a trillion dollar market...so we have a long way to go\u201d Jon said. We were grateful to get the perspective of two founders of a young company that has already amassed $1 billion in assets under management and raised $45 million in capital to grow their business. </p>\r\n<p>We then made our way to the offices of <a href=\"http://www.pave.com/\">Pave</a>, a P2P lending startup and a founding <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/about/sponsors/index.html\">sponsor</a> of Wharton FinTech, where we hosted by the firm\u2019s founders, Oren Bass and Sal Lahoud, as well as Kathryn Ebner (Business Development), David Rosen (Head of Underwriting), Ray Tamblyn (VP of Product) and Nick Kucharski (Lead Engineer). Having team members from each department in the company gave club members the opportunity to ask questions about topics ranging from entrepreneurship, FinTech in New York vs. London, and credit risk modeling. In addition to witnessing Pave\u2019s impressive cohesiveness and collaborative spirit in action, we left with a clearer picture of the challenges that a startup can face in a highly regulated environment, such as fair lending standards, investor protections and securities law. Hearing how data analytics drive technology decisions or impact of marketing strategy on hiring made for a conversation that really educated everyone involved and set up a number of follow up connections.</p>\r\n<p>We ended our day with the investors at <a href=\"http://www.fintech.io/\">FinTech Collective</a>, a FinTech-focused VC firm, and two of their portfolio companies, <a href=\"https://www.reonomy.com/\">Reonomy</a> and <a href=\"https://openfolio.com/\">OpenFolio</a>. Getting a VC perspective was an invaluable way to round out our tour of FinTech in NYC.  Gareth Jones, Co-Founder and General Partner at FinTech Collective, discussed the rise of crowdfunding and how lower cost of capital is driving change in the traditional VC model and what this means for investing hopefuls looking to break into the industry (hint: you might need startup experience). We also discussed how the availability of data around portfolio companies and user behavior is impacting the early stage investing process and the way VCs think about growing their portfolio companies. Richard Sarkis, the CEO of Reonomy and an alumnus of Wharton, told us how Reonomy is reinventing commercial real estate through the use of big data and machine learning. We also heard from OpenFolio, who is bringing the power of networks to the world of personal investing. Overall, we learned a lot from the FinTech Collective team about banking, capital markets, payments, bitcoin and regulatory arbitrage, and both enjoyed the lively discussion and people we met. </p>\r\n<p>One of the biggest takeaways from the trip was seeing first-hand the burgeoning and exciting tech scene in NYC. For most of us, this was the first time interacting with startups in NYC and by all measures, there are a lot of synergies to be had when choosing to headquarter there, particularly in Silicon Alley. Pave specifically discussed the decision to move from San Francisco to NYC in the early days of the company in order to lower operating costs and take advantage of the <a href=\"http://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NY-FinTech-Report-2014.pdf\">growth of FinTech startups in NYC</a>. If you are an entrepreneur or you are <a href=\"http://whartonjournal.com/2014/11/03/consider-recruiting-for-fintech/\">considering a job in FinTech</a>, you should attend the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/NewFinanceNewYork/\">NewFinance FinTech Meetups</a>, subscribe to <a href=\"http://www.alleywatch.com/\">Alley Watch</a> or reach out to <a href=\"mailto:info@whartonfintech.org\">Wharton FinTech</a> to help connect you to the right people.</p>\r\n<p>Getting to hear from a diverse group of FinTech companies working on SMB lending, automated investing, digital currency, P2P lending and VC was invaluable to those who attended. We are thrilled with the success of the trek and are looking forward to our next trek to the San Francisco Bay Area  in February 2015. Please <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/about/contact-us/index.html\">contact us</a> if you are interested in hosting an engagement with Wharton FinTech and stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks!</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Paulynn provides a recap of the Money20/20 conference and covers the hot trends in fintech, including innovations in the payments industry, bitcoin and Apple Pay.",
    "title": "Beyond Payments: Highlights from the Money20/20 Conference",
    "text": "<blockquote>\"Bitcoin is better than currency.\" <small>Bill Gates</small></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Bitcoin is a mirage.\" <small>Warren Buffett</small></blockquote>\r\n<p>In the opening session of Money20/20, these opinions flashed on screen \u2013 thoughts from two influential people not ordinarily associated with financial technology. I attended the 2014 Money20/20 conference with peers of mine from Wharton and what we loved most were the hot topics, influential speakers and contrasting opinions on display.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, some Vegas-style glitz added icing to the cake \u2013 in the exhibit halls, we saw a human-size robot charming guests, rock band performances by attendees and even a live DJ performance during intermission. With its own twist, the opening video satirically rapped about physical point of sale innovations and the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2brZQocmMc\" target=\"_blank\">future of dough</a>.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{% static \"img/articles/20141201-collage.jpg\" %}\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\"></p>\r\n<p>Money20/20 drew over 6,500 participants, more than a threefold increase in attendance from only two years ago. The conference attracted over 500 speakers and we saw a diverse range of experts from the payments, financial services, retail, mobile and commerce industries as well as representatives from both start-ups and established companies. It really did feel like the entire payments ecosystem was concentrated at a single conference.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{% static \"img/articles/20141201-graph.jpg\" %}\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\"><br /><em>Source: Money20/20 brochure</em></p>\r\n<p>With a day and a half of hackathons, 18 topic tracks (consisting of multiple panels), 20 keynote speakers and hundreds of booths running all-day in the exhibit halls, the experience was at times overwhelming to say the least. Here are the key topics covered and highlights that we came away with:</p>\r\n<h3>Digital Currency</h3>\r\n<p>Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin. There was no other word uttered more often during the entire conference. A (Bit)coinWorld track ran for three days covering everything from security and legal issues to the simple (or not so simple) mechanics of the blockchain.</p>\r\n<p>What got us most excited was not the coin but rather the bit. While we originally thought of bitcoin as a currency, many believe the biggest possibilities are in the underlying technology itself.</p>\r\n<h3>Apple Pay</h3>\r\n<p>Apple has finally entered the payment space and people couldn\u2019t stop talking about the development - even without an Apple presence at the conference itself! As Jim McCarthy (Global Head of Innovation and Strategic Partnerships at Visa) commented: \u201cThe cycles are long in the industry. ATM, debit cards took 15 years. For Apple Pay, it took a year to get the banks signed on.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>The real test for Apple Pay will be to gain customer and merchant adoption. As Google Wallet and SoftCard can attest, it\u2019s not an easy nut to crack.</p>\r\n<h3>Technology at the heart of it all</h3>\r\n<p>True to the \u201ctech\u201d part of financial technology, innovation was the focus of the conference. Beyond FinTech startups, even companies like Uber, a non-payments company, were praised for helping drive payments friction to zero. Attention was also given to iBeacons and their potential for a new type of retail experience. It was no surprise that there were tracks dedicated to Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Commerce Disruptions, and Innovations in Online Payments.</p>\r\n<h3>It\u2019s not just about payments</h3>\r\n<p>The payment space is overcrowded with incumbents, tech giants and over 2,000 startups striving for a foothold in this well-developed ecosystem. Money20/20 was the ultimate beauty pageant for hundreds of these companies.</p>\r\n<p>One of our favorites was <a href=\"https://getpoynt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Poynt</a>, standing out to us for its physical design and integrated solution (PoS that works with NFC, chip and pin, QSR and beacons).  Founded by Google Wallet\u2019s ex-chief Osama Bedier, Poynt is also an open software platform where developers can build cashiers or other finance apps.</p>\r\n<p>As wonderful as the idea of frictionless and secure payments is, Money20/20 wasn\u2019t just about actual payments.</p>\r\n<p>First, big data was a hot topic as companies are eager to analyze the myriad of payments data that is now available. Omni-channel marketing was a hot conversation as payments companies can now provide more and more business intelligence to merchants using Point of Sales (PoS) systems.</p>\r\n<p>Second, it\u2019s important to remember that payments is really about enabling commerce and delivering value to merchants.  Improving the ease of doing business makes this a high-impact space.  As Deborah Liu, Head of Payments and Commerce at Facebook, explains: \u201cPayments happen when commerce happens.\u201d The battle for the payments crown may look brutal but we are optimistic that the competition, partnerships and exchange of ideas does produce huge value for merchants and consumers alike.</p>\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Money20/20 really was a great opportunity to network and take part in thought-provoking conversations with a wide range of FinTech companies. We were particularly fascinated by the conversations we had on digital currency, Apple Pay, as well as the evolving payments space and can\u2019t wait for next year\u2019s conference!</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Maria breaks down some of the conversations from the Future of Money conference specifically on bitcoin, decentralization of financial services and money management.",
    "title": "Highlights from the Future of Money Conference",
    "text": "<p><em><a href=\"http://www.futureofmoney.com/\">The Future of Money and Technology Summit</a> was held on Tuesday December 2nd and brought together entrepreneurs, developers, investors and academia to discuss innovation and the development of money and financial services. Maria Halpern is based in Silicon Valley and represented Wharton at the conference in San Francisco.</em></p>\r\n<p>The Future of Money conference provided a great opportunity to network with entrepreneurs, developers and investors in the FinTech space. Below are our key takeaways from three of the speaker panels that we had a chance to attend!</p>\r\n<h3>Money Management and Changing Consumer Expectations</h3>\r\n<p>The conference kicked off with a fireside chat about \u201cThe Future of Money Management Technologies\u201d featuring industry leaders Bill Harris (CEO and Chairman of <a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com\">Personal Capital</a>) and Barry Saik (SVP/GM of Consumer at <a href=\"http://www.intuit.com\">Intuit</a>). The discussion focused on changes in the consumer landscape. First, they believe that in the next ten years we will see a deconstruction in the delivery models of financial services, because young consumers are more willing to adopt new financial technology and they expect to have instantaneous access to their money. As Saik explained, \u201cOur cell phones will become ATM machines.\u201d Additionally, the millennial generation has a low appetite for paying high fees for incumbent financial services, which is causing a fundamental shift in how companies engage with customers. The demand for transparency is influencing financial technologies \u2013 and as traditional financial institutions start to adapt, there is a huge opportunity for disruption. For startups, \u201cbarriers to entry are disappearing and the amount of competition is surprisingly low,\u201d according to Harris.</p>\r\n<p>Harris struck a chord with the audience when he made the comparison to the transformation of industries that exchange physical goods or services (i.e. retail and healthcare) because of electronification. According to Harris, many financial services transactions can be electronified. This is why Harris believes the financial services industry will be one of two industries most changed by connectivity (the other being media). This point raised some questions as to the future of client interactions, particularly for personal financial advisors. Harris qualified his point and emphasized the that the interpersonal piece is \u201cremarkably important\u201d especially when you talk about long-term financial goals, but \u201coften that relationship can be delivered electronically,\u201d he said. Saik then took it one step further by describing certain areas where technology can replace the human element \u2013 for example, re-balancing a portfolio \u2013 saying \u201cthat should just happen, you don\u2019t need a person to do that.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>This led into a conversation about millennials \u2013 Saik said that young people who use services like <a href=\"http://www.venmo.com\">Venmo</a> literally talk about their money in a different way. As Saik explained, \u201cThey share everything, talking about what they buy and spend. Their pain points are around timing of transactions (i.e. how do I split rent four ways and then pay on time) and immediate cash flow.\u201d While both Saik and Harris agreed that disintermediation hasn\u2019t fully happened yet in financial services, this kind of consumer behavior makes them believe it will happen at an accelerated pace.</p>\r\n<p>The bottom line of the discussion was that transparency and information in the client\u2019s hand is paramount. Harris cited research proving that people who download financial information on a mobile device see a 15% decrease in spending. Harris likened it to losing weight \u2013 \u201cyou need a measurement and a scale\u201d. Time to make those New Year\u2019s resolutions!</p>\r\n<h3>Bitcoin and the Decentralization Movement</h3>\r\n<p>It came as no surprise that the Bitcoin panel was standing room only. The panel featured a strong lineup including Jackson Palmer (Creater of <a href=\"http://dogecoin.com/\">Dogecoin</a>), Sonny Singh (Chief Commercial Officer of <a href=\"http://www.bitpay.com\">BitPay</a>), Sean Percival (Partner at <a href=\"http://500.co/\">500 Startups</a>), and fourth-generation Venture Capitalist Adam Draper (founder of <a href=\"https://www.boost.vc/\">Boost VC</a>) and was facilitated by Mark Rogowsky, Entrepreneur and Tech writer for Forbes magazine.</p>\r\n<p>The discussion began with a debate about the volatility of Bitcoin, which yielded a range of insights from the panel. Percival said that he \u201ctries to avoid focusing too much on volatility\u201d because he is thinking more about the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d than Bitcoin as a currency. On the flipside, Draper said volatility is in fact a problem with Bitcoin. Palmer agreed and described Bitcoin price volatility as a two-pronged problem: merchants don\u2019t want to accept it when price is so volatile and consumers are less likely to spend it since the value could double tomorrow. While Bitcoin volatility has stabilized recently (to quote Draper, \u201cthings have been a little boring\u201d), Draper likened the price volatility to a constant ticker for \u201chow enthused people are about Bitcoin\u201d. In closing, Draper said that the smartest engineers are going into this market so the value must be going somewhere and there will be a delayed hit rate to the price.</p>\r\n<p>The conversation then shifted into overall Bitcoin transaction volume where there seems to be some evidence that the number of transactions are trending slightly upwards. Percival explained that it\u2019s hard to track monthly active users and it\u2019s likely hit a plateau. Draper claimed that the real problem is that it is still unclear where Bitcoin actually adds value. We need the \u201ckiller Bitcoin use case for mainstream America \u2013 it has to be easier to use and obtain he said. Furthermore, the US is the \u201cworst place for Bitcoin to take off\u201d because \u201ceveryone has a credit card\u201d and \u201ctrusts their banks\u201d. According to Draper, Bitcoin adds most value in markets where only 10% of the population has bank accounts and 90% have cell phones and he believes that micro and cross-border transactions will ultimately be where Bitcoin adds the most value. Palmer agreed and added that in order for it to take off, someone needs to create a \u201cWhatsApp\u201d like application that would make it easier for people to download in developing nations.</p>\r\n<p>Rogowsky then shifted the conversation to other digital transactions like Apple Pay and Venmo and asked whether these services are a good or bad thing for Bitcoin. The panelists all seemed to agree that these services are a good thing because they get people used to the idea of digitized dollars. Even though it\u2019s unlikely that Apply Pay will accept Bitcoin, once Apple gets millions of people to tap their phone to pay then it\u2019s not too much a leap forward to move to a decentralized currency.</p>\r\n<p>So what needs to happen for regular people to care about Bitcoin? Draper said people relate bitcoin to \u201cblack markets\u201d and \u201cillegal goods\u201d and the industry has to address the public relations issues. Singh said that at BitPay, employees are able to receive part of their paychecks in bitcoin currency, but believes that that Bitcoin needs to be easier to obtain overall. The whole panel agreed that some regulation would actually be a good thing, since it would legitimize Bitcoin and hopefully make it easier for Bitcoin companies to launch and grow.</p>\r\n<p>Singh summarized the panel\u2019s vibe best when he said, \u201cWe are in the second inning of a nine inning game\u201d.</p>\r\n<h3>Corporate Investment in FinTech Startups</h3>\r\n<p>After a much-appreciated sushi break in Japantown, the conference reconvened with an interesting panel about corporate investment in FinTech startups. The panelists were from VC arms of large banks including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Citibank, Capital One and BBVA. The panelists talked about how their respective banks approach investing and discussed the most interesting technology investments today. According to the panelists, here are the most and least interesting areas for investment:</p>\r\n<p>Most interesting areas for corporate investment:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Big data/analytics solutions to solve problems for banks (e.g. portfolio optimization)</li>\r\n<li>Emerging markets banking solutions</li>\r\n<li>Non-payment applications of mobile (e.g. a mobile solution that will download and translate market data and lead to a buy/sell transaction)</li>\r\n<li>B2B payment/procurement solutions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Least interesting areas for corporate investment:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Peer to peer payments</li>\r\n<li>Digital lending that isn\u2019t built on good technology</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Throughout the day, it was interesting to hear panelists and attendees reflect on quickly changing consumer expectations, the decentralization movement and future of new financial technologies being developed today. By the end of the day, it was clear that financial services are ripe for innovation and we can\u2019t wait to see all the progress that will be made by next year\u2019s conference!</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Elise covers the innovative approach that Capital One is taking in financial services, including their use of human-centered design thinking and culture.",
    "title": "The Digital Focus & Importance of Design Thinking at Capital One",
    "text": "<p>The banking industry is changing as financial institutions focus on improving the customer experience and look for ways to compete in an increasingly competitive environment. Many companies have started internal innovation centers and incubators to access and test new ideas.</p>\r\n<p>Capital One Bank is a bank focused on customers\u2019 digital experience and recently acquired Adaptive Path, a San Francisco-based design and user experience consultancy. I had the opportunity to speak with Daniel Kahn, who works in Digital Strategy and Innovation at Capital One to learn about Capital One\u2019s work in the digital arena.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thanks for taking the time to speak with me. Jumping right in, can you tell us about the evolution of the digital focus at Capital One?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Capital One was founded on an information-based strategy. In some ways, we were a \u201cBig Data\u201d company before that term was invented. What we need to do to evolve is prove that a bank can use that data intelligently, deliver value for clients, and design an experience that is delightful and intuitive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you describe what you mean by an \u201cinformation-based strategy\u201d and how Capital One used it?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sure. It\u2019s hard to imagine now, but in the 1980s most banks had a fixed price (APR) for credit cards. The way that Capital One (and others) were able to enter and disrupt this market was by offering differentiated interest rates based on a customer\u2019s creditworthiness. This expanded the total market size for credit cards and gave the company valuable experience underwriting loans to customers that were traditionally excluded by the major banks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Banking is a highly regulated industry and, because of the more traditional nature of banks (compared to start-ups), it can be difficult to create a culture of innovation. What is Capital One\u2019s culture like? How is the company structured to innovate?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Capital One\u2019s culture believes in the power of data. It\u2019s sort of like that old William Edwards Deming quote: \"In God we trust, all others bring data.\" The good news is that we are still a founder-led company and our CEO has set out some pretty aggressive targets in terms of innovation. That means paying attention to all of the startups out there, but not just copying them for the sake of a \u201cme too\u201d strategy. We\u2019re investing in Digital Labs, design thinking, and user experience (through acquisitions like Adaptive Path).</p>\r\n<p><strong>What exactly is the \"Digital Lab?\"</strong></p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.capitalonelabs.com/#/%23/news\">Capital One Labs</a> (in New York, San Francisco, and Washington DC) focus on building products that are 18-24 months ahead of our current business. The people in the Labs often come from a startup background and are a mix of developers, design thinkers, product managers, and data scientists. The Labs test out new concepts using a human centered design approach, with the goal of taking the most successful concepts and building them into full-fledged products or features for our customers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Adaptive Path\u2019s Chief Creative Officer remarked that \u201c[Capital One has] built sophisticated practices in digital product design, design thinking, and experience research and development that we can build on and cross-pollinate with our practices.\u201d Can you tell us more about what kind of design principles Capital One uses?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Within Digital and the Labs we are focused on the human centered design experience. That means getting out there and talking to our customers, seeing how they live their lives, solving some of their existing challenges, and also trying to surprise and delight them. One example of that is a program we launched called <a href=\"http://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/benefits/second-look/\">Second Look</a>. Second Look scans your transaction history for either suspicious purchases (like a double swipe) or bills that vary more than usual (say your Comcast bill increased from a promotional rate to a higher price point). We launched this as a Minimum Viable Product with just email alerts, but the response from customers has been so positive, we are now looking at how to expand the offering. Second Look is actually a good example of co-creation with our customers, since we are tweaking the experience based on real-time customer feedback.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you go about gathering customer feedback?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We use a mix of methodologies to get feedback from customers. For digital products, we evaluate usage data and also send out surveys. But we also have design researchers who focus on immersive research (observing how customers use the product without guidance) and other qualitative research techniques.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How have you seen the banking industry shifting to focus on the customer?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Banking traditionally has been a utility and is moving to be more focused on how the customer interacts via mobile, digital, tablet, or video. This changes the basis of competition and makes it difficult to compete if you move slowly. You need to anticipate customer needs and solve them proactively. Service is a differentiator as well. Banking is in the customer services industry and when a bank can provide a value-add for customers through service, the impact on customer loyalty is significant.</p>\r\n<p>There is a great quote from Benedict Evans about the role of humans and computers. He said, \u201cA computer should never ask a question it already knows the answer to.\u201d Customers get frustrated inputting the same information repeatedly. So our challenge is how to take all of these systems and integrate them seamlessly, to make the customer experience that much better.</p>\r\n<p><strong>In a world where customer data security is of huge importance, how is Capital One innovating in this space?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are two quick examples that spring to mind. The first is <a href=\"http://www.capitalone.com/campaigns/sure-swipe/\">SureSwipe</a>, a feature which makes it easier for customers to log in and access their data on mobile, without having to remember (or re-use) the same password over and over. The other is our Digital Wallet, which launched with ApplePay last month. When customers use their iOS device to pay \u2013 either at the point of sale or online \u2013 we will send a single use token instead of the customer\u2019s full 16 digit credit card number. This makes life harder for fraudsters and gives our customers more confidence that they can use their phone for payments.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For Wharton MBA students, do you have any suggestions for pursuing a career in digital strategy and innovation?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As most alumni will tell you, the soft skills are incredibly important. Every day I think back to classes like communications and negotiations, but only occasionally do I have to build a really complicated financial model (although it does happen!). In this type of role, you\u2019ll have to influence people, both internal stakeholders and partners, tap into different parts of the organization, build new projects with limited resources, and then argue for why those projects should be launched at scale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>One last question: from a personal standpoint, what is a company you admire for their digital and innovation leadership? What do you think Capital One can learn from them?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I think Larry Page has done an incredible job at Google. If you look at the company, they are firing on all cylinders when it comes to innovation. One of the reasons Google is able to move so quickly is that different groups are empowered to participate, whether it is through 20% time, Google X, investing via Google Ventures, or corporate development acquiring startups. When I think about where we want to get as an organization, that model is incredibly helpful, since it seeks out innovation from multiple sources both inside and outside the company.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Sasha interviews the executive team of Prosper Loans to discuss customer satisfaction, data and trends in peer-to-peer lending.",
    "title": "Prosper, The Importance of Data & Customer Satisfaction in P2P Lending",
    "text": "<p><em>The following is an interview between Wharton FinTech VP of Education, Sasha Dobrolioubov, and Aaron Vermut (CEO), Ron Suber (President), and Karl Hu (Business Operations Manager) of <a href=\"https://www.prosper.com/\">Prosper</a>. This interview took place December 4, 2014.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Prosper is America's first <a href=\"https://www.prosper.com/welcome/how_it_works.aspx\">peer-to-peer lending</a> (P2P) marketplace, with more than 2 million members and over $2 billion in funded loans.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about Prosper, your mission and how you differentiate from other P2P lenders?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Prosper is an online credit marketplace that serves both borrowers and investors. On the borrower side, we serve three main types of individuals: people with credit card debt who would like to refinance and/or consolidate their debt, people who are seeking a loan in order to make a major purchase or investment, and entrepreneurs who want to borrow on their personal credit for business purposes.</p>\r\n<p>On the other side of the equation are the investors, both individuals and institutions. We connect our investors with our borrowers and help investors generate steady, solid returns. Our long term mission is to continue to serve both sides of this equation \u2013 to create financial products that will help investors and borrowers improve their financial well-being.</p>\r\n<p>We believe that our focus on the customer helps differentiate Prosper from other P2P lenders. Customer satisfaction as measured by NPS (net promoter score) is very high and we\u2019re seeing a lot of repeat borrowers and investors. We also offer the most comprehensive automated investing program on the market in order to streamline the investing process for our customers. Additionally, we want to remain a pure play business \u2013 we\u2019re not looking to enter the wealth or investment advisory space, for example. We believe this focus will help us continue to offer the best P2P loan products in the market.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you see as your main competitive advantage vs traditional lenders, such as big banks and credit unions?</strong></p>\r\n<p>One of Prosper\u2019s key advantages is our operational structure \u2013 unlike banks, we don\u2019t have to pay for branches and tellers. This allows us to be much more operationally efficient, leading to cost savings that we can then pass on to borrowers in the form of better rates and to investors in the form of solid returns. Our simple borrower application, coupled with a streamlined and automated underwriting process, allows us to make quicker loan decisions. And our customers are highly satisfied \u2013 check out our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/prosperloans\">Facebook page</a> to see what borrowers and investors are saying.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Let's talk about data. Big banks have a wealth of data on their customers, and we're seeing alternative lenders such as Kabbage start to use non-traditional data such as a small business's Amazon reviews to help evaluate creditworthiness. How does Prosper plan to innovate and compete on data used for underwriting decisions?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We have a proprietary data asset that we\u2019ve refined over the past eight years and that\u2019s really the core of our business. This data \u201cscorecard\u201d specializes in underwriting and pricing loans of $2,000 to $35,000. It\u2019s our competitive advantage and will continue to be our core asset going forward, as we incorporate new technology and improve our risk models.</p>\r\n<p>As far as using social data to make credit decisions \u2013 it\u2019s an innovative concept but there\u2019s not enough substance there to make a pricing or underwriting decision on its own. Social data has to be backed up by traditional risk data, such as FICO score and annual income. If you don\u2019t have these fundamentals, you\u2019re going to be in trouble.</p>\r\n<p><strong>One of your competitors, Lending Club, recently announced plans for an IPO, looking to raise up to $800M from investors. How do you think Lending Club's IPO will impact the P2P lending sector, and specifically Prosper, going forward?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We\u2019re very excited about Lending Club\u2019s IPO! It will be a branding moment for everyone and will help legitimize the whole industry. It\u2019s truly a watershed moment for P2P lending. We view our competition not as Lending Club or banks but rather as the lack of understanding and awareness around online marketplaces for credit.</p>\r\n<p>Prosper will see ripple effects as well \u2013 the IPO and associated coverage will help educate consumers and raise awareness for what we do. P2P lending is still in a nascent stage \u2013 outside of major cities there\u2019s not much awareness of the industry. We want people out there to know that there\u2019s a better way to borrow and a better way to invest, and Lending Club\u2019s IPO will serve as an announcement for all of us that P2P lending is exciting, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s here to stay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For a company like Prosper, how do you think MBAs can add the most value as potential full-time or intern employees?</strong></p>\r\n<p>At Prosper, we\u2019re focused on building a team of the smartest people we can find. We\u2019ve had a ton of success with MBA graduates and have a number of people on our team from Wharton undergrad and MBA. We have a data-driven culture and we\u2019ve found that MBAs with a quantitative background and sharp analytical skills fit well at Prosper. We also look for out-of-the-box thinking and creative problem solving \u2013 skills that are typically in the arsenal of most MBAs. Business school grads with an entrepreneurial spirit and a proactive, scrappy attitude will thrive here.</p>\r\n<p>We consider Prosper to be a unique intersection of banking, finance and Silicon Valley, and we have roles where MBAs can make a significant impact, such as product strategy, business operations, corporate development and investor services. For those candidates with technical backgrounds, product management is an area of opportunity as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Consumer credit is just one piece of the US credit industry as a whole. Looking ahead, do you see any intriguing opportunities on the horizon for Prosper?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our goal is to make our financial product more accessible to more customers. We\u2019re exploring different levers that we can pull within our core loan product that will enable us to penetrate new consumer verticals such as life event loans, elective medical loans or home improvement loans. Tactically, we\u2019re going to be more aggressive in mobile in 2015, and we\u2019re revamping our marketing efforts with a focus on the branding and look and feel of our website. As we\u2019ve discussed, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on serving individual consumers. Lending directly to businesses is not a priority at this time but we will continue to support borrowers who take out personal loans for the business purposes.</p>\r\n<p>At the start of 2013 Prosper was about 10% of the U.S. P2P lending market (in terms of loan origination); we\u2019re closing 2014 at over 40% market share and growing. In Q3 2014, $495M of loans were originated through Prosper and $1.2B through Lending Club. This is a fantastic time for the P2P lending industry and we\u2019re super excited about the future!</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Courtney talks to Dan Egan from Betterment to learn more about robo-advisors, algo-investing and how the company is using data to automate investment management.",
    "title": "How Betterment is Redefining the Retail Investment Landscape",
    "text": "<p>How has technology changed investment management? What are my online investment options? How can I easily create a portfolio of investments that align with my risk preferences? I had the opportunity to speak with Dan Egan, Director of Behavioral Finance and Investing at Betterment, to address these questions and learn more about how Betterment is redefining the retail investment landscape.</p>\r\n<h3>What is Betterment?</h3>\r\n<p>Betterment, headquartered in New York, is an online investment management platform that provides investment advice and fully automated diversified investment management to customers while charging fees that are much lower than those levied by traditional investment advisors. They offer both taxable and tax-advantaged retirement accounts composed of portfolios of stock and bond indexes. With Betterment, you cannot invest in individual stocks; rather you can invest generally in the stock market through instruments known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Customers can tailor their investments to meet unique needs and specific goals. Whether it's a college fund or vacation account, Betterment will use guidelines such as time horizon, liquidity requirements and risk tolerance to advise on a diversified investment portfolio of ETFs to achieve these goals.</p>\r\n<p>Online wealth managers such as Betterment are often referred to as \"robo-advisors\", but Dan argues that \"algo-advisors\" is a more appropriate term to use. The service they provide isn't performed by robots, but rather based on key algorithms that appropriately allocate investments based on your unique investor profile. </p>\r\n<h3>Algo-advisors and the over-due impact of technology on investment management</h3>\r\n<p>Humans play the more important role of figuring out what questions to ask. Dan elucidated this by applying an interesting quote from Pablo Picasso: \"Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.\" We have seen incredible progress in the development of artificial intelligence with Deep Blue beating Garry Kasparov in chess and Watson winning Jeopardy in 2011. In that sense, it's actually strange that it has taken this long for computers to find their place in investment management and other financial services. For Betterment, computers serve to perform the algorithms that exist in an advisor's head more quickly and precisely, and with less bias. </p>\r\n<h3>Who uses Betterment?</h3>\r\n<p>Betterment customers are interested in building for the future and are looking to make investments to do so. An intuitive interface and mobile offering make Betterment easy for anyone to use. In fact, they have seen a large influx of pre-retirees who are planning for retirement five to ten years down the road. While the younger generation may have a natural affinity for services like Betterment, Dan doesn't view the typical customer as \"millennials, or any other stereotype,\" but rather anyone with the following three qualities:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>They are comfortable managing their money/wealth on the web</li>\r\n  <li>They are looking for an index-tracking approach to investing</li>\r\n  <li>They want to save time/money and be more effective than DIY</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>I was most interested in the first quality and curious to know if that served as a barrier to attracting new customers. Dan doesn't seem to think so and highlighted the well-designed interface and low fee structure as value propositions to investors. Customers of Betterment and investors in general exhibit a wide range of financial literacy. Betterment's easy to navigate interface offers full reports as well as \"Reader's Digest\" versions to explain their investment advice and practices.  People have different financial circumstances and levels of comfort so Betterment makes sure to offer strategies that can make everyone better off. Dan argues that \"Betterment is the least expensive option for most investors,\" so investors seeking an index-tracking approach see the highest return when using Betterment simply because their fees are much lower than those charged by the average investment advisor. </p>\r\n<p>Betterment also offers tax loss harvesting (TLH+) to ensure investor returns are maximized. Put simply, tax loss harvesting involves the sale of a security that has experienced a loss and the use of that loss to offset taxes on both capital gains and income. \"No one likes paying taxes,\" Dan points out, so Betterment also makes sure to show customers the tax implications of their investment decisions so that they can understand their final returns after taxes.</p>\r\n<h3>Understanding risk and new metrics for measuring it</h3>\r\n<p>Understanding and creating portfolios based on risk are key to the success of any investment manager, whether it's an human investment advisor or an \"algo-advisor.\" Traditional investment advisors typically use a series of questions to identify risk tolerance and then create portfolios that they think align with this tolerance. Dan believes this is where an advisor can become a liability, in some cases. The portfolio is formed with input from two humans, the investor and the advisor, and can inevitably reflect the preferences of the advisor rather than the client. There is an unconscious bias at play that may cause a portfolio to be more customized to the advisor than to the investor. A computer will never display any behavioral bias and an algorithm can better tailor to the investor and ensure that the portfolio is customized to their specific goals and risk tolerance. </p>\r\n<p>Betterment focuses on its customers risk capacity and caters portfolios to meet their needs. They are able to leverage unique metrics such as the number of times a customer logs in to check their investment to estimate the risk tolerance of customers. This feedback loop, which also includes such metrics as the frequency with which customers update their portfolio allocation, provides Betterment with relevant data to consider when measuring risk tolerance and the ability to ultimately better serve their customers.</p>\r\n<h3>The competition and how traditional investment management firms are responding</h3>\r\n<p>Online investment management and the FinTech space as a whole have both seen tremendous growth over the past few years, so Dan and I spoke about some of Betterment's competition. Wealthfront is their main competitor, but traditional investment management firms such as Charles Schwab have also announced plans to offer online investing similar to Betterment, but without fees. On traditional investment management firms, Dan shared the following thoughts: \"It's very hard to be concerned about something that doesn't exist yet. And about something that is essentially mimicking the innovation we've done. Schwab had 40 years to come up with our suite of features and services, and didn't.\" To that point, Betterment puts the customer first and is focused on continuous improvement of its product and services. </p>\r\n<h3>What's next for Betterment?</h3>\r\n<p>Dan wasn't able to share too much, but he did let me know that there are more and more new products and services coming our way -- \"everything from personalization to making more complex and sophisticated investment management services that are usually only available to the very rich - now available to everyone.\"</p>\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Betterment is clearly helping make retail investing easier to understand, more sophisticated and more accessible for everyone. Whether you're intimidated by the stock market or just don't have the time to do the necessary research, their \"algo-advising\" approach could be the solution.</p>\r\n",

    "title": "Wharton FinTech: A Recap of our First 100 Days",
    "text": "<p><em>This was originally emailed to all our supporters on Monday, January 26, 2015.</em></p>\r\n<p>Dear Wharton FinTech Supporters,</p>\r\n<p>Happy New Year and we hope this finds you in great spirits! The fall of 2014 was an incredibly busy time for Wharton FinTech and we wanted to provide you with an update on our first 100 days. When we came to Wharton, we both wanted to get involved in FinTech in order to stay in touch with the industry and to source employment opportunities. We\u2019d be lying if we told you that we had an impulse or desire to be those passionate (read: weird) \u201cFinTech Guys\u201d. As you know, Wharton has long been synonymous with the finance industry, but the resources that are available to entrepreneurs and innovators are quite remarkable. Given the campus presence on both coasts (Philadelphia and San Francisco) and geographic proximity to New York City, a burgeoning haven for FinTech startups, we started to test a theory with everyone we met: Wharton should be the center for FinTech thought leadership. To our excitement, no one laughed us out of the room and hundreds of our classmates seemed to share our beliefs. Many were interested in working for startups, corporate financial innovation labs or leveraging prior experience in finance to found FinTech companies. We reached out to our networks and discovered that there was latent demand from the industry for a channel for students who care about innovating in financial services and who want to build careers in FinTech. And, to our surprise, there were no other MBA FinTech organizations in the US or abroad. We didn\u2019t ask permission (at first) and we decided to start <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/\">the first student-led FinTech initiative club</a> here at Wharton. </p>\r\n<h3>Our First 100 Days</h3>\r\n<p>Here are some of the milestones we are most proud of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>We recruited and selected an initial Executive Board of eight incredibly talented students who have been really driving the mission and execution of Wharton FinTech.</li>\r\n  <li>To promote inclusiveness and take the focus off monetizing membership, we are the only professional club at Wharton that does not charge dues and our membership has grown to well over 200 students from several undergraduate and graduate schools at the University of Pennsylvania such as the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Education, the School of Engineering and, of course, Wharton.</li>\r\n  <li>Sasha Dobrolioubov, VP for Education, developed and delivered educational sessions on both the <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/blog/p2p-lending/\">peer-to-peer lending</a> and <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/whartonfintech/20-nov2014-personal-financial-managementve-42621900\">personal financial management</a> markets, and has been responsible for spearheading our \u201cLunch and Learn\u201d sessions that have attracted guest speakers from <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/NewFinance/\">NewFinance</a> and Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS).</li>\r\n  <li>In November, 20 club members joined a <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/blog/silicon-alley-growing-fintech-nyc/\">trek to New York</a> to visit with FinTech firms and venture capitalists, including <a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/\">Betterment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.secondmarket.com/\">SecondMarket</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fintech.io/\">FinTech Collective</a>.</li>\r\n  <li>James Chaukos, our VP of Content, has been busy overseeing the development of the outstanding original content featured on the <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/blog/what-is-fintech/\">Wharton FinTech blog</a>, which has been a huge success. We\u2019ve published 16 articles in 16 weeks, and have attracted nearly 1,000 unique visitors during the last month alone.</li>\r\n  <li>Sudipta Bandyopadhyay, VP of Technology, has been our guru for all things tech and in addition to building our awesome website, he wrote the only - that we\u2019ve ever seen - article outlining the <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/blog/programming-languages-financial-innovation/\">programming lanagauges of financial innovation</a>.</li>\r\n  <li>On Twitter, we have attracted over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whartonfintech\">600 followers</a> and Cameron Peake, VP of Communications, has been working on a strategic branding and public relations campaign that we will roll out in the next few months.</li>\r\n  <li>Along with the MBA Career Management Office, Richard Bhamb, our VP of Careers, has developed a database of hundreds (and counting) of FinTech industry contacts that supports our mission to \u201cconnect innovative, established, disruptive and prove FinTech enterprises with students\u201d.</li>\r\n  <li>We are also proud to have been supported by our founding sponsors: <a href=\"http://www.infrastructuregroup.net/\">Infrastructure Group</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pave.com/\">Pave</a> and <a href=\"http://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/\">WRDS</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Looking Forward</h3>\r\n<p>This semester, Wharton FinTech is heading to the West Coast to meet with FinTech startups and investors in San Francisco and Palo Alto, including <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/\">NerdWallet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/accounts/primary\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wealthfront.com/\">Wealthfront</a>. We will be offering the opportunity for students to engage with <a href=\"https://www.prosper.com/\">Prosper</a> on an independent study project, and we are bringing speakers to campus from FinTech firms such as <a href=\"https://chain.com/\">Chain</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aspiration.com/\">Aspiration</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wefinance.co/\">WeFinance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tilt.com/\">Tilt</a>. We will be finalizing our work on a FinTech Industry Map that we hope to distribute widely and we are working on educational content around payments, blockchain economics and FinTech social impact.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to managing our budget, Carissa Feria, VP of Finance, is leading efforts to memorialize our operating procedures and corporate governance principles so that Wharton FinTech can continue to grow and mature for many years. </p>\r\n<p>As we stride into 2015, we remain focused on our original goal: to make Wharton the center for FinTech thought leadership by promoting and sharing ideas for innovation and investment in financial technology. We want to thank you for your support as we continue to grow Wharton FinTech. We are so pleased with the progress thus far and we are really excited about all the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we wanted to share some exciting news. Matt Carey, a second year student who has been instrumental in getting Wharton FinTech off the ground, has decided to defer his last semester at Wharton to get his startup <a href=\"https://myabaris.com\">Abaris</a> off the ground. Via the annuity market, they\u2019re working to make it easier for Americans to purchase more Social Security for themselves in the private market. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing what 2015 brings for him and his co-founders.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out at any point with feedback on what we\u2019re up to or ideas for where we can be dedicating our time and resources.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Warm Regards,<br />Daniel and Steve</p>\r\n",

    "description": "Daniel sits down with Evan Baehr, Founder of small business lending startup, Able Lending, whose mission is to \u2018power the Fortune five million\u2019.",
    "title": "Able Lending and the Fortune 5 Million",
    "text": "<p><em>Powering lending for main street entrepreneurs.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The following is an interview between Daniel McAuley, Co-Founder of Wharton FinTech, and Evan Baehr, co-founder of Able Lending. This interview took place February 16, 2015.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about Able.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our mission is to \u2018power the Fortune five million\u2019, which refers to the five million small businesses who would never be able to raise venture capital or equity financing. Currently, most of financing options for this group of small businesses come with interest rates over 50% through alternative products like merchant cash advances. Able sits in the chasm between traditional nonprofit social enterprise lending and traditional high rate lenders.</p>\r\n<p>Able is a non-bank non-depository lender. Our loans require that the borrower raise 25% of the capital towards their loan from three to five people, called their backers. This subordination structure allows us to always provide a lower interest rate to our borrowers compared to other lenders.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is Able\u2019s competitive advantage versus traditional lenders?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We have seen a massive erosion of community banks alongside major consolidation of the big banks. There were roughly 100,000 banking institutions about 100 years ago, while today there are about 5,000. The Dallas Fed reports that around 80% of deposits are held in the top ten financial institutions. All of this makes the government nervous about consumer protection, so they tighten underwriting restrictions on the banks.  This allows new entrants (without bank charters) to capture all sorts of value that the banks are no longer able to capture.</p>\r\n<p>There are two critical things that an alternative lender specifically must do. The first is to acquire customers, in this case, borrowers, at a reasonable cost. The second is to access lending capital to fund loans, because you don\u2019t have deposits. Our structure of having friends and family in the loan gives us a competitive advantage in achieving those two components.</p>\r\n<p>First, we lower acquisition costs by making all of our loans public. We create beautiful content to broadcast every loan so our borrowers post and share that information. That is a very bizarre behavior to pull off in the lending market because most ecosystems and products create an experience in which people are embarrassed to have borrowed money. When we make it public and have the five backers in the loan, those people can share in the success in the funding of that loan, generating tens of thousands of free impressions for Able.</p>\r\n<p>The second is to attract lending capital at a reasonable rate. So far, capital providers love the 25% subordinated tranche in our loans because anticipated loss rates on the portfolio are very low. And that\u2019s a structure not built on lending to extremely creditworthy borrowers or to various established businesses. That\u2019s something that results only from the structure we have to the loan itself.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Let's talk about data. How does Able plan to innovate using data in underwriting decisions?</strong></p>\r\n<p>When developing Able we assumed that many companies were trying to innovate on underwriting itself. But it turns out that the institutional players are very suspicious of innovation in underwriting. So when we are out trying to raise lending capital, our message must be that we are not even attempting to innovate in underwriting. What we\u2019ve found is that the market is very suspicious of using nontraditional big data for underwriting because we have over fifty years of historical data in the United States through multiple business cycles that has led banks to build very sound, very predictable and very accurate underwriting models.</p>\r\n<p>In the case of Able, we do see some interesting data on the backers of our borrowers\u2019 loans. We\u2019re able to examine credit data of the backers so that we can understand more about you as a borrower and over time we can understand more about you and your credit risk based on the kind of people that you bring into your deal. However, it\u2019s a really important distinction to understand that when you train your model on historical data you can only do so on the data and variables that you have access to. The process of introducing, testing and analyzing new data considerations takes up to a full business cycle to determine if these variables are significant. So you might not know if new variables are increasing the lift of a credit model for up to ten years. The proposition that people are really innovating in underwriting is one we have found is not very persuasive in the market, particularly for lending capital.</p>\r\n<p><strong>One of your competitors, OnDeck Capital, recently IPOed. How do you think this has impacted the small business lending sector and what does this mean for Able?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The OnDeck and Lending Club IPOs were both great in terms of capital markets. They invited dozens, probably hundreds of new institutions into the space. The data that came out in those S1\u2019s is interesting for everybody and a few points jumped out. I believe that OnDeck\u2019s average interest rate was about 56%, which in every single state is actually usurious and illegal to charge. It\u2019s not that OnDeck is breaking the law that is interesting.  To me it\u2019s interesting that OnDeck, this sexy, amazing FinTech company backed by Midas-list VC\u2019s is charging rates that most people think of as rates charged by payday lenders.  To add insult to injury, their margins aren\u2019t even very healthy.  We think that their rates are driven by smaller dollar loans over very short terms with high default rates and extremely high acquisition costs. When you put those things together it\u2019s a race to the top to drive interest rates up. This leads to an adverse credit selection effect whereby only unhealthy businesses choose to seek that kind of capital because they can\u2019t access it at a lower rate elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>The other thing coming out of the S1\u2019s is the reliance on brokers, which are these networks of totally wildcard, unknown quantities that have the leads. So Lending Club and OnDeck are doing everything they can to build out sales teams and better direct mail campaigns. However, they can\u2019t shake their huge reliance on broker networks, which is a huge problem for them because they end up paying up to six percent of the loan amount to the broker in the form of a fee.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you think MBAs can add the most value as full-time employees or interns at FinTech startups?</strong></p>\r\n<p>These are two specific pieces of advice that Chris Cox, the VP or Product at Facebook gave to a set of MBAs when I was there. First, get very good at data. Many MBAs are expected to know Excel and how to build models and how to run regressions. In a startup, MBAs may be looked at to perform analysis and make decisions about which products to launch, or evaluate conversion funnels and various marketing campaigns. It is also helpful to learn about SQL and how is data stored and accessed so that you know how to query data to perform analysis and make suggestions yourself. The last thing you want to do as an MBA is make requests of the dev team; trust me, they are already rolling their eyes enough!  Second, learn about design. In general, MBAs have a very bad aesthetic. We\u2019re comfortable with Excel and legal documents but developing an appreciation of aesthetics and learning practical skills around the execution of design are both important. The practical execution side involves being conversant in Photoshop, being able to manipulate images and make changes in things like marketing campaigns and landing page optimization.</p>\r\n<p>At FinTech companies, I think MBAs fall into one of two categories. You may be in the substance of the financial analysis that the company is doing, so you understand asset allocation, or consumer credit underwriting, or commercial credit underwriting, or options trading. If you really understand the math that\u2019s driving the product then you can come in working on product, you can join the credit team, you could be on an operations team. If you don\u2019t understand that, then your more natural areas to fit in would be business development or operations of any type, such as borrower operations or lending operations. Marketing is also an area where MBAs with training around data analytics can be very helpful in FinTech companies. Being very comfortable designing and running tests of many variants of ads across Google Adwords, Google Display and Facebook, and being able to infer from those results things about product positioning and messaging around your product is extremely valuable. Then there are some interesting components of business development and capital market formation where your previous experience could be directly helpful to a FinTech startup navigating that world. So if a company relies on hedge funds or other specific institutional investors as core partners, then someone working in business development who brings in those relationships could be helpful to a FinTech company.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Any final comments?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Overall, I am curious to know how alternative lenders will make any money. It seems that the underlying products are commodities; terms loan, MCA, unsecured consumer, etc. The underlying credit models are not only the same models, they are also relying on the same data from the same bureaus. The acquisition costs are so high that most lenders lose money on every loan they fund. They are all working to develop the same acquisition channels of direct mail, digital marketing, inside sales, broker relationships and other partner relationships like bank referrals. They\u2019re also all running after many of the same providers of lending capital, and because these products are commoditized, the providers are always going to go to where the cheaper rate is. In that sense I find it hard to understand how many, or maybe even any, of these companies will actually make money at the end of the day. When Lending Club makes a comment that part of the IPO rationale was to raise a war chest so that they could build a nationally known brand, and that national brand awareness was possibly critical to bringing down the cost of acquisition of consumer borrowers, then the business that all of these companies are getting into is the same business that brick and mortar banks are in--which is national brand awareness. So it\u2019s scary to me that it may not be about the credit model and it may not be about the product\u2014rather, it\u2019s all about the marketing optimization. I think that many people would not go start FinTech companies if they knew that the main thing they\u2019re trying to do is increase the open rates of direct mail.</p>\r\n<p>Now, you might say, well then why are we building Able? To us, Able is the only lender that has even the condition for the possibility of a differentiated product, which gives us a chance at pursuing the monopoly product position that Peter Thiel talked about in <a href=\"http://zerotoonebook.com/\">his most recent book</a>. It all comes back to this reality: if everyone else has a commoditized loan product, we\u2019re the only one that had created a non-commodity option\u2014actually a fundamentally different underlying product which enables us to have different strategies for customer acquisitions and debt capital markets development. At this stage we clearly do not know if our loan structure works. We may not know that for years, but we at least know that we have a chance of a differentiated strategy in which our margins do not go to zero. And that is not something that I can say conclusively about any other alternative lender of which we are aware.</p>\r\n",

    "text": "<p>When my submarine would dive beneath the waves, we\u2019d lose the ability to communicate with the outside world and the crew would work diligently to avoid making excessive noise to prevent being detected. Nicknamed the \u201cSilent Service\u201d, the submarine force fosters a culture that is intensely focused on preserving operational security <em>and</em> cybersecurity. We undergo rigorous background checks and conduct continuous training to ensure that we are ready to combat emerging threats to our networks. But despite its cultural acceptance of cybersecurity, the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304526204579101602356751772\">Navy hasn\u2019t been immune from cyber attacks,</a>, which should be a cause for concern for any other organization that is trying to protect their digital assets. Since leaving the military, I\u2019ve been amazed by my peers\u2019 lack of awareness of cyber threats, for example, how easy it is to become complacent with information in the era of cloud computing (I\u2019m composing this article in Google Docs). So it\u2019s easy to understand why an entrepreneur wouldn\u2019t have any concern with putting the company\u2019s information in the cloud instead of implementing potentially higher cost and more secure enterprise network solutions. However, <a href=\"http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2015/feb/20/federation-small-businesses-warns-continued-security-fears-smbs-cloud/\">according to the UK\u2019s Federation of Small Businesses</a>, only two-fifths of over 1,200 small businesses surveyed in the UK were skeptical about the benefits of cloud computing compared to the security tradeoffs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"{% static \"img/articles/20150320-concerns.png\" %}\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" alt=\"Cloud computing security concerns ranked\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>For FinTech companies, cybersecurity should be a top priority. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/03/us-sec-cybersecurity-idUSKBN0L727420150203\">According to the SEC</a>, \u201cat least 88 percent of broker-dealers and 74 percent of advisers have been the target of cyberattacks\u201d and banks - such as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-10/dimon-sees-jpmorgan-doubling-250-million-cyber-security-budget\">JPMorgan</a> - are spending a lot of money to beef up their cyber defense, and small business owners or startups are <a href=\"http://www.itpro.co.uk/security/24126/cyber-security-not-a-priority-for-smbs-research-shows\">just as susceptible to looming cyber threats</a>, but may be slow to adopt new security protocols. We want to arm FinTech entrepreneurs with the information that they need to safely operate their businesses, while highlighting some of the industry\u2019s innovations and trends.</p>\r\n<h3>Wharton Cybersecurity Event</h3>\r\n<p>In an effort to raise awareness about cyber threats in the finance industry, Wharton FinTech recently welcomed Juliet Okafor, Global Director of Business Development and Marketing at <a href=\"http://www.trushieldinc.com/\">Trushield Security Solutions</a>. Trushield is a global cybersecurity company that provides comprehensive network and data security, risk management and compliance solutions to Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and international organizations that need to protect sensitive data or meet information technology security mandates. The discussion with Ms. Okafor was highly interactive and geared toward FinTech entrepreneurs who are looking to strike the right balance between growing their startup and protecting against imminent cyber threats. According to Ted Schlein, <a href=\"https://www.kpcb.com/partner/ted-schlein\">a veteran investor at Kleiner Perkins</a> with several cybersecurity deals under his belt, \u201cthere are two types of companies: those that know they\u2019ve been breached, and those that haven\u2019t figured it out yet.\u201d Furthermore, we at Wharton FinTech want to highlight the importance of admitting a breach. \u201cIt is my belief that companies that have been hacked can be further broken down to those that have come clean to the public about their breaches and those that haven\u2019t,\u201d says Daniel McAuley, Wharton FinTech Co-Founder. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important distinction, because the sooner a company comes clean about an attack, the sooner the cybersecurity industry can innovate to neutralize new threats. Sharing details about previous vulnerabilities doesn\u2019t expose a company to further attacks. It makes everyone else stronger. This is one of the aims of <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-panel-easily-passes-cybersecurity-bill-1426197297\">the cybersecurity bill</a> passed by the Senate last week. However, even if this bill becomes law, it remains to be seen if it will be strong enough to create open corporate information-sharing environment.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>While investing in cybersecurity software and hardware solutions can be expensive, the return on investment can provide peace of mind to an entrepreneur - but it\u2019s not all about throwing more money at the problem. \u201cProcedures and policies need to be in place and can contribute to a better overall awareness and company culture of protecting proprietary information,\u201d said Ms. Okafor. She also likened cybersecurity protocols to having brakes on a car: \u201cbrakes allow a car to travel faster and slow down if necessary. Cybersecurity protects a company\u2019s assets so it can innovate and grow.\u201d</p>\r\n<h3>The Future of Security</h3>\r\n<p>The silver lining in the cyber threat cloud (excuse the pun) is that there is strong competition in the market for cybersecurity and investment dollars are flooding into the space. According to <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/cybersecurity-startup-financing/\">CB Insights</a>, over $7 billion dollars have funded over 1,000deals over the last five years and investment is steadily increasing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"{% static \"img/articles/20150320-investments.png\" %}\" class=\"img-responsive img-thumbnail\" alt=\"Cybersecurity Financing History: Investment Deals and Dollars\" title=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Lucas Nelson, a Principal with Gotham Ventures and co-author of <em>The Art of Software Security Testing</em>, recently outlined the cultural and technological <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/cybersecurity-themes/\">themes that are transforming the cybersecurity market</a>. \u201cThe first cultural trend comes from the admission that no system is truly secure,\u201d Mr. Nelson writes, citing the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-05/as-data-breach-woes-continue-targets-ceo-resigns\">resignation of Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel</a> as an example. Secondly, security breaches, such as the ones that occurred at Target and JPMorgan, and even the US Navy example mentioned earlier, are often caused by malevolent outsiders, but the privacy issues at the NSA that were unveiled by Edward Snowden have caused ordinary citizens to take pause and government officials to direct efforts toward insider threats. According to Mr. Nelson, the technological trends that are driving cybersecurity innovation are cloud security and the Internet of Things, but \u201csecurity has always lagged behind new technologies\u201d and data migration to the cloud means that companies employing legacy cybersecurity solutions \u201cno longer control the infrastructure that employees are utilizing\u201d. Additionally, the Internet of Things allows connectivity to more devices, which provides \u201ca much larger surface of attack for the average consumer\u201d.</p>\r\n<p>The next wave of technological advancements harness the powers of machine learning to proactively neutralize new threats and the blockchain protocol to provide enhanced cryptographic techniques to secure networks. <a href=\"http://www.cylance.com/\">Cylance</a> offers multiple products and services including CylancePROTECT a proactive machine learning platform that predicts previously un-detected malware and continuously learns to respond to new threats by \u201ctraining\u201d on large data sets. While <a href=\"http://everchain.com/\">Everchain</a>, a FinTech startup based out of Philadelphia, provides enterprise and mobile solution that utilizes blockchain technology to secure transactions and communications in the cloud. The powerful combination of an influx of investor dollars and the continuously evolving cyber threat landscape, means lots of innovators will be compelled to devote time and effort to growing cybersecurity businesses.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources For Entrepreneurs</h3>\r\n<p>For a startup, an expensive cyber defense may not be your highest priority when you want to meet milestones and grow your business. A <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242772\">recent article</a> in <em>Entrepreneur</em> highlights four steps that a company can take to enhance their cybersecurity posture in today\u2019s threat environment. Additionally, every entrepreneur should be aware of the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10\">Top 10 Cyber Threat List</a>, which is published by Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) a not-for-profit organization that provides information about software security solutions. For a deeper look into what actions an entrepreneur can take, we turned to Ngozi Nwaneri, a first-year MBA Candidate at Wharton, who has studied information security and worked in private equity and financial services to develop an <em>Entrepreneur\u2019s Primer for Cybersecurity</em> (see below). We would love to <a href=\"mailto:whartonfintech@gmail.com\">get your feedback</a> as we periodically update this primer so it can continue to be useful as new techniques, policies and threats emerge.</p>\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\r\n  <iframe class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"http://docs.google.com/gview?url={% static \"img/articles/cyber-security-entrepreneurs-primer.pdf\" %}&embedded=true\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n",

    "description": "Steve sits down with Laura Forth, Managing Director of College CFO, a student-driven organization that provides resources to educate students about personal finance.",
    "title": "Student-Driven Financial Empowerment: Interview with College CFO",
    "text": "<p><em>The following is a Q&amp;A excerpt between Steve Weiner, Co-Founder of Wharton FinTech, and Laura Forth, Managing Director of College CFO.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>College CFO is a student-driven organization that provides resources to educate students about budgeting, student loans, interviewing, investing, credit cards and much more.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about College CFO and how it\u2019s differentiated in the financial education space?</strong></p>\r\n<p>College CFO is a company that\u2019s tailored for college students that are transitioning from the safety net of college to the real world after graduation. By the time you graduate, students already need to have a good credit score, which means that they already need to have been building credit using a credit card or a small student loan. As soon as students begin going through this transition, they are hit with student loan repayments, which they may or may not be ready for. They\u2019re going to be receiving paychecks that subtract unknown kinds of taxes from their salary. They will have to do their own taxes for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>Higher education is not doing a very good job of preparing students for these life skills. College CFO tries to fill the gap in students' financial education. One of the ways that we do that is through our nine-module Financial Empowerment Course. Each module takes about 30 minutes to complete, and goes over everything from student loans, to investing, to identity theft. Upon completion of the course, students receive the Financial Empowerment Badge, a certification that they can affix to their resume or LinkedIn profile.</p>\r\n<p>College CFO\u2019s resources also make a direct connection between financial literacy and early career success. While money management skills will benefit students\u2019 finances, there is research to support that financially literate employees are perceived as being more engaged and productive by employers.</p>\r\n<p>College CFO also has a suite of supplemental tools that support the course content. We have the Student Loan Snapshot tool that pulls all student loan information together into one dashboard. Personalized job boards, resume keyword analysis, and other tools help make a purchasing a College CFO membership an easy decision.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why do you think it\u2019s the right time to tackle financial education? Is this a really big problem in the U.S. right now?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Student loan debt in the U.S. is roughly $1.3 trillion. 65% of students graduating from college hold student debt at an average of about $30,000. That\u2019s the same percentage (65%) of students that report misunderstanding their student loan requirements. There is a severe lack of education about personal finances in this country, but especially when it comes to paying for college. Parents and students alike are unprepared to pay the ever increasing cost of higher education. College CFO is focusing on financial literacy education for college students so that they don't have to carry the burden of paying for their diplomas for the rest of their lives. Contrary to those who say that millennials enjoy freeloading off their parents, we believe that students crave financial independence and are not being given the right resources to achieve it. It\u2019s our mission to be that resource.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are some of the common misunderstandings that your customers have about financial literacy?</strong></p>\r\n<p>One misunderstanding among both students and parents is that financial understanding will just happen on it\u2019s own. We find that most of our members are uncomfortable talking about money in general. We see that lack of communication amongst peers and between students and their parents. Unfortunately when there is no communication, learning about finances often happens as the result of avoidable mistakes.</p>\r\n<p>Another misunderstanding is about the benefits of investing savings. This generation grew up during the financial crisis seeing first-hand what can happen when markets fail. There is widespread misunderstanding about why it\u2019s important to save early and invest intelligently. This problem is compounded by the fact that recent graduates\u2019 first long-term savings account is often a 401k or IRA. When they are in their early twenties, retirement feels like it\u2019s never going to reach them. We\u2019re trying to tackle a lot of those misconceptions with education.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How are you overcoming the challenge that people don't like talking about money and finances?</strong></p>\r\n<p>College CFO is providing tools for students <em>and</em> parents that will help them form a budget and talk about investing. One of our most popular tools is our <a href=\"http://collegecfo.org/game/\">Beer Budget Envelope game</a>. It works like this: Students and parents write down everything that they can spend money on for five minutes. Then they go over every line item together. This simple exercise is usually eye-opening for both sides. The next step is figuring out how much money the students can spend over the course of a semester. Once they figure out their top line, students and parents allocate money in a series of envelopes, each for a different expense. Parents are then encouraged to talk about potential rewards if the student sticks to a budget or consequences if they cannot. Going through this exercise helps students and parents share expectations and opens up lines of communication.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How did you get started at College CFO?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The founder of College CFO, Susan Bruno, is a friend\u2019s mother. She founded a company called DivaCFO, which provided financial resources to women who were going through financial change as a result of divorce, debt, disaster, etc. DivaCFO had college interns who revealed to Susan that they didn\u2019t understand the resources that they were giving these women. Susan decided to expand her mission to include college students and recent graduates. I was brought on as an intern to build the original website for what was then called \u2018CollegeDivaCFO\u2019. Once the website was built, I began providing content. Once the content was written, we needed someone to market it. About six months ago, we formed a partnership with iGrad, a financial literacy education provider. With iGrad\u2019s help we are now able to offer an expanding suite of tools and educational resources. I\u2019m am very excited about College CFO\u2019s increasing ability to educate students and graduates about personal finance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How can people get involved and help College CFO?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The best way that you can help College CFO is by spreading the word. Right now, we are trying to expand the number of people that our education is reaching. The best way that you can help is by actively educating yourself with our tools and sharing your experience. It\u2019s easier than you think, we promise!</p>\r\n<p><strong>What advantages do you see to being a \u201cvirtual classroom\u201d?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thanks to iGrad\u2019s help, College CFO is an entirely online platform. We have very strong social media content and a supplemental <a href=\"http://collegecfo.org/\">blog</a> where we publish student atrticles about what they think about money, testimonials from students who have gone through our program and our <a href=\"http://collegecfo.org/category/richardbranson/\">Virtual Mentor Series</a> where we use excerpts from Richard Branson's book <em>The Virgin Way</em>. One of Richard\u2019s philanthropic missions is financial literacy and he believes that College CFO is doing good work in this space. We are looking forward to sharing more of his content in the future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next for College CFO?</strong></p>\r\n<p>College CFO wants find out from our members what kind of products they are looking for next. Our number one goal is always to provide members with relevant tools for their success. Leveraging feedback to yield new products and improvements is an important part of our future. One thing that we are considering is grouping our course content around objective rather than subject. So instead of a module about credit reporting, a group of modules around buying your first car. That may be something that we pursue, but I can\u2019t give away too much right now. As always, we will continue improve our products to make them better for our members.</p>\r\n",

    "title": "Wharton FinTech Goes West: Industry Trek to the Bay Area",
    "text": "<p>For two sunny days in late February, students from Wharton FinTech visited the San Francisco Bay area for our second FinTech Industry Trek. Building off the <a href=\"http://www.whartonfintech.org/blog/silicon-alley-growing-fintech-nyc/\">successful trip to New York City\u2019s Silicon Alley</a>, we ventured out of the icy northeast and caught up with some of the world\u2019s most exciting FinTech startups. The trek was oversubscribed with 24 participants and included 11 company visits in San Francisco and two in Palo Alto. The following is a brief rundown of our itinerary - including some tidbits of advice that the founders, investors and operators had for students and aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n<h3>Asset Management</h3>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.personalcapital.com/\">Personal Capital</a></strong> seeks to provide better financial services to consumers with a client-centric business model that with a client-centric business model that combines a human advisor with financial software.</p>\r\n<p><em>Life advice:</em> Bill Harris, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/bill-harris-launches-personal-capital\">Founder and CEO of Personal Capital</a>, suggested that young entrepreneurs should \u201cknow your own strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s ok to have weaknesses as long as you find team members that supplement the weaknesses.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.wealthfront.com/\">Wealthfront</a></strong> is an algorithmic wealth management platform that aims to provide investors with investment products that are low on both cost and human intervention.

    "title": "Abaris Financial and the Revolution in Retirement Spending",
    "text": "<p><em>The following is an interview between Daniel McAuley, Co-Founder of Wharton FinTech, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/careymatthewr\">Matt Carey</a>, Co-Founder of <a href=\"https://www.myabaris.com/\">Abaris Financial</a>. This interview took place March 22, 2015.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Abaris is a first of its kind online marketplace for annuities that sells directly to consumers. Their initial focus is on Deferred Income Annuities (DIAs), a product that can protect retirees against longevity risk.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Annuities are something that a lot of people may not be familiar with. Can you start by giving us a little background on Abaris and your product?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Let\u2019s start with annuities. An annuity is a recurring form of income that lasts for your entire life. Examples of annuities that most people are familiar with are Social Security and corporate pensions. Social Security is an annuity provided by the government and pensions are an annuity provided by an employer. An annuity is provided by an insurance company and you purchase it yourself. Maybe it helps to provide an example. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m 55 today, I want my annuity to start paying me at age 75. $10,000 today could buy you as much as $1,900 a year, every year starting at 75 for as long as you live. And that\u2019s really important, that last part: as long as you live. You no longer have to worry about whether you live to 85, 90 or 95. You want to live as long as you\u2019re healthy and happy and you don\u2019t have to worry anymore about your money running out. These types of products are underwritten by large insurers, household names like MetLife, Lincoln Financial, The Principal, or MassMutual, so buyers can have confidence that income will be there when they retire. We\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re working to become appointed with all of these insurers.</p>\r\n<p>Abaris is the platform where people can actually purchase these products. Right now, you have to go through individual insurance agents who might not be appointed to sell a lot of different insurance carriers\u2019 policies. We are able to quote and sell a majority of the market, but we\u2019re not creating these products. What we\u2019re doing is providing people the place to learn about annuities, compare different insurers\u2019 side-by-side and then complete the purchase if they decide to buy. We\u2019re doing kind of like what Orbitz has done for flights or what <a href=\"http://coverhound.com/\">Coverhound</a> is doing right now for auto insurance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why is retirement spending such an important problem to solve and why isn\u2019t much being done about it?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s important to solve because in almost every case retirees today are either overspending and running out of money or underspending and forgoing the lifestyle they could have had. In addition, no matter what happens, retirees are losing a lot of peace of mind along the way.</p>\r\n<p>I think there are two reasons though why more hasn\u2019t been done to solve it. The first is that getting people to save for retirement is still an unsolved problem. In order to develop solutions for better retirement spending you first need to make sure that you\u2019ve saved enough and figuring out how to get people to save more and invest it appropriately is really challenging. Only recently have you started to see some big developments with companies like Wealthfront or Betterment getting people to do a better job saving and putting that money away and kind of forgetting about it and investing it in a really smart, tax efficient, behaviorally sound way. The markets are still largely focused, for a good reason, on getting people to save enough, so the idea of retirement spending is only starting to be talked about. The innovation is only starting and we\u2019re at the forefront of that. The second reason we haven\u2019t seen as much being done about it is because of the demographic. Customers who buy DIAs tend to be nearing retirement, so between ages 50 and 65. And only recently has Internet usage and comfort with online purchasing reached a point where the market was ready for this. If you look, for example, about where Facebook\u2019s domestic user growth is coming from, it\u2019s basically the baby boomers and those who are a little bit younger. They\u2019re doing a lot more online these days than just checking e-mails. So now we feel like it\u2019s finally the time to launch this product because our customers feel comfortable with a process that is partially online, especially at the beginning of the sales funnel.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What do you see as Abaris\u2019 main advantages when compared to insurance agents and other competitors?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We have a few advantages over insurance agents who are the ones selling most of the policies today and the first of those is education. At the moment, annuities are sold, not bought. What that implies is that it requires really pushy sales tactics and often times a \u201cfear driven\u201d sales approach to get people to purchase annuities. We don\u2019t think that, in this day and age, people should be buying because they are psychologically forced into a corner. What we\u2019re doing is providing everyone with information about when it makes sense to purchase a DIA but also when it doesn\u2019t, and that is pretty unique in this market. Second, we offer people the ability to compare different product offerings, and I talked about that a little bit earlier but right now your insurance agent might only be appointed with one insurance carrier and they\u2019re just going to try and sell you that product. But you never know if you\u2019re getting the best price, if you\u2019re getting an annuity from an insurer that is very safe with a high credit rating, and the trade off you\u2019re making between price and credit rating, those sorts of things. So comparison is not something that really exists today and we\u2019re providing it and that\u2019s a huge value proposition to the consumer. Lastly, our cost structure is lower, so our incentive is to make sure that you get the best price, not to sell you a product where we get paid the highest commission, and that also is a big difference. So you can be sure that we have your best interests in mind when you\u2019re on our platform.</p>\r\n<p><strong>There are a lot of mental biases that come along with consumer financial products specifically. What is Abaris doing to help consumers overcome these hurdles and where do you see your biggest challenges?</strong></p>\r\n<p>That\u2019s a great question and something we\u2019ve been focused on since the beginning. The first advisor we brought on is a professor by the name of Hal Hershfield. Hal is a Stanford Ph.D. and teaches at UCLA, and his focus is on the type of issues you mentioned. The biggest psychological issue here is present bias. In order to purchase one of these products, you basically have to say \u201calright I\u2019m going to take money that I could spend today and put it in a product that\u2019s not going to start benefiting me for a long time into the future.\u201d And that requires a lot of foresight and we know from psychology that that can be challenging. What Hal has done in his research is demonstrate that if you show someone an aged version of their own face, they are much more likely to save. We\u2019re going to incorporate things like that into our platform so people can combat this present bias. Another thing we\u2019re dealing with is, and the annuity market has very much had a challenge with this, is choice overload. We wish the market were as simple as, \u201chey I want an annuity right now that starts paying me at age 70 or 75 or 80 and I want it to be inflation-protected the whole time and that\u2019s that. Tell me what I should buy.\u201d But right now products aren\u2019t that simple. The market has added a lot of complexity and customization and what we\u2019ve tried to do is essentially say, \u201calright, tell us a little bit of information about yourself and we\u2019ll suggest some default options so that you\u2019re not overloaded with all these choices and, if you want, you can customize that but we\u2019ll tell you why we chose these default options.\u201d We think it\u2019s really important to get people to actually feel comfortable with what they\u2019re doing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>This is all really cool, innovative and exciting, and it sounds like it\u2019s very good for the consumer. Are the existing insurance companies and the other players in the annuity space supportive of what you\u2019re doing or are you getting pushback from entrenched interests?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I think I would describe it as more support than push back. From the insurance carrier\u2019s perspective this is another channel for them, another way for them to get their products into consumers\u2019 hands. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that the insurance industry has been a bit behind in terms of innovating on distribution, underwriting and marketing. Now what we\u2019re starting to see is a lot of interest in the insurance community to do more because their customer base is shifting in terms of who is buying these products. The average 50 year old wasn\u2019t thinking about this at all ten years ago and now they certainly are. Everyone, carriers especially, see the opportunity and want to figure out how they can fit this in both right now and as part of their future product roadmap.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Annuities are just one of many financial products specifically. Where do you see opportunities for Abaris to apply this model that you\u2019ve developed to other markets or products?</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you think about how quickly pensions have gone away over the last three decades and how much less of someone\u2019s total spending needs that Social Security actually provides than it used to, you realize that we\u2019ve got a huge opportunity in DIAs alone. In many cases, this product is the one that should be filling that gap and it is not really today in terms of sales volume. So we think there is a really large opportunity to get this product in more people\u2019s hands. That\u2019s our focus for the near and medium term. One way we\u2019re thinking about innovating further in this market is by making it easier for people to purchase these products in low dollar amounts on a recurring basis. Right now, you have to save up 10, 20 or 50 thousand dollars before you buy one of these and it\u2019s pretty challenging for folks to make that big of a decision and it\u2019s not really how they think about their money. Right now, every two weeks, money comes out of your paycheck to go to your 401(k). There\u2019s no reason why in the future some of the money you\u2019re taking out of your paycheck for your 401(k) can\u2019t go straight into an annuity and fund your DIA on a recurring basis. By expressing it in terms of monthly income, people can see actually how much they\u2019re saving for retirement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for aspiring FinTech entrepreneurs out there, particularly MBAs that may not have technical experience?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I think the key is to go after a market you know. I chose this market, for example, because I worked on retirement policy at the Treasury Department at a time when there was a lot happening in this area. I got to learn the space pretty well and I saw an opportunity to bring technology into the market. I think you\u2019re always going to have the easiest time pursuing a startup in an area that you know really well because otherwise there are inevitably going to be things that surprise you along the way. I\u2019d say that\u2019s the biggest piece of advice I have. At the same time, I think financial services and insurance are certainly behind the curve in adopting technology. I think that there are lots of opportunities right now to go out there and find a niche, carve it out, acquire customers and really build a profitable growing business.</p>\r\n<p><strong>That\u2019s great advice. Before we close do you have any last words you\u2019d like to leave us with?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Two things. The first is a huge thank you to you and Steve and the rest of Wharton FinTech. This group didn\u2019t exist during my first year at Wharton and in less than a year\u2019s time it\u2019s already made a huge impact on innovation in financial services, not just at Wharton but in the broader FinTech community. You guys have really established yourselves as thought leaders and that\u2019s great for the school and the industry. Second, this issue we\u2019re talking about is a really big one and I think people are starting to understand how big it really is. When Social Security was created you had people living maybe five or seven years into retirement. Now, on average, a 65 year old is going to live to about 88 and by the time we\u2019re ready to retire that number could be well into the 90s. And what this means is that if you\u2019re living for 30 years post-retirement you really having to think a lot harder and more seriously than in the past about how you\u2019re going to accumulate enough money to live and then how you can be more sophisticated in spending that money down. We\u2019re super excited about what we\u2019re doing because we think that this is just the beginning. There\u2019s going to be a lot more innovation in the space and we feel like this will be a transformational couple of decades for retirement spending.</p>\r\n",

    "title": "How FinTech Reimagines the Meaning of \"Underbanked\"",
    "text": "<p>Ask what \u201cFinTech\u201d means to someone in social impact, and I can almost guarantee that his or her answer is \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d. It\u2019s a term more popular in the social impact world, and for all intents and purposes it\u2019s synonymous with FinTech for people in impact investing, international development and elsewhere in the space where technology bridges the infrastructure gaps that prevent access to banks in the first place. From microfinance to mobile payments to alternative loan services, FinTech has already <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_miracle_of_financial_inclusion\">proven itself a pillar of the social impact world</a>, capable of fulfilling the so-called triple bottom line: people, planet and profits.</p>\r\n<h3>FinTech + Social Impact = Financial Inclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Financial inclusion is defined by the <a href=\"http://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/\">Center for Financial Inclusion</a> as <em>\u201cA state in which all people who can use them have access to a full suite of quality financial services, provided at affordable prices, in a convenient manner, and with dignity for the clients. Financial services are delivered by a range of providers, most of them private, and reach everyone who can use them, including disabled, poor, rural, and other excluded populations.\u201d</em> The term was first used in 1997, according to the Financial Inclusion Commission, and has since been used to describe efforts to give financial access to the traditionally unbanked or underbanked.</p>\r\n<p>From my perspective, it\u2019s easy to see how FinTech fits into social impact. I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time researching and sourcing companies with the <a href=\"http://whartonsocialventurefund.org/\">Wharton Social Venture Fund</a> (a student-run impact investing fund), and individually in Latin America, where I spent my last summer looking into how social enterprises measure impact. I\u2019ve also been fortunate enough to be exposed to quite a number of financial inclusion ventures through my work as a Fellow for <a href=\"http://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/\">Wharton\u2019s Social Impact Initiative</a>, and through my own career search. As I\u2019ve become more familiar with the social impact sector and financial technology as a tool, I\u2019ve come to recognize financial inclusion as the intersection of the potential of FinTech and social impact.</p>\r\n<h3>What makes FinTech so important to Social Impact?</h3>\r\n<p>Shifting perceptions and uses of both new and traditional financial services - like M-Pesa, CommonBond, and even \u201ctraditional\u201d microfinance - are exactly what makes FinTech so crucial to the social impact space. In the most basic terms, people are coming to expect more and better quality products and services from the finance industry: FinTech is bridging the gap between current offerings and expectations by fostering innovation on both the provider and consumer end of the spectrum. Startups such as those mentioned above, then, are thinking about what\u2019s possible in terms of changes to existing financial structures: i.e., fundamental shifts in how consumers interact with their money and with financial institutions.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the more technical groups in FinTech are focused on the <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/9483/greater-promise-blockchain/\">possibilities of the blockchain</a>, the <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1630275\">disintermediation of the banking services</a> and, of course, <a href=\"http://boostcompanies.com/fintech/\">data and analytics</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Social impactors have their eyes on the same trends, but with a distinct perspective: they\u2019re wondering how FinTech \u2013 and the innovations and trends thereto \u2013 can be harnessed to benefit the underserved. Now, definitions of who fits into that \u201cunderserved\u201d market vary widely; social impact is still relatively young as an industry, after all, and it\u2019s still going through some growing pains. Trends like micro-loans and mobile payments are often associated with rural populations in the developing world, who we might see as the traditionally \u201cunderserved\u201d market.</p>\r\n<p>The interesting thing about FinTech, however, is that in a sense <em>all</em> of us are underserved. FinTech isn\u2019t just about solving problems at the base of the pyramid or in just the developing world: it\u2019s about making financial technology, and more importantly, financial access, available to everyone, everywhere.</p>\r\n<h3>Redefining the Under and Unbanked</h3>\r\n<p>Allow me to demonstrate with the most pertinent example. When we hear \u201cunbanked\u201d and \u201cunderbanked\u201d we tend to think of exactly those populations I mentioned earlier: rural, poor, and outside of the developing world. But the fact is 7.7% of US households were unbanked and 20% were underbanked in 2013, <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/\">according to the FDIC</a>. That\u2019s not a negligible number by any means. Data on the penetration of retirement plans \u2013 401(k)s, IRAs, etc. \u2013 is equally as dismal: only 16% of American workers have 401(k)s, and 40.4% have IRAs, according to ICI Global. Worst of all, about one-third of those with retirement accounts haven\u2019t even started saving. Talk about an opportunity for FinTech!</p>\r\n<p>Mobile payments technology is perhaps the most well known implementation of FinTech in social impact, with companies such as <a href=\"https://www.mpesa.in/portal/\">M-PESA</a>, <a href=\"http://kifiya.com/\">Kifiya</a> and <a href=\"https://venmo.com/\">Venmo</a> swiftly and drastically altering the financial landscape in both the developing and developed worlds. In other words, physical cash is not necessarily king anymore. Alternative loan and refinancing services \u2013 think Wharton startups <a href=\"https://commonbond.co/\">CommonBond</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nexu.mx/\">Nexu</a> \u2013 have also been proliferating widely <a href=\"http://www.consumerinterests.org/assets/docs/CIA/CIA2012/2012-57%20who%20uses%20alternative%20financial%20services%20and%20why.pdf\">across incomes, geographies and demographics</a>. And who can forget Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that is fundamentally changing the definition of access and ownership of monetary value.</p>\r\n<h3>Going Forward</h3>\r\n<p>Clearly, financial access, tools, literacy and, most importantly, financial freedom are social issues that span the globe. FinTech has enabled \u201csocial impact\u201d upon each of these factors through innovation in payments and financial services. However, I believe FinTech\u2019s biggest social impact potential has yet to be realized. The approach so far has been relatively piecemeal (by which I mean individual solutions to portions of the overall problem) and is only the first step. I believe FinTech\u2019s real impact is going to be the ability to give anyone \u2013 from the unbanked farmer in Ecuador to the savvy investor on Wall Street \u2013 access to and, more importantly, control over their financial resources. In my personal opinion, FinTech, in conjunction with social impact, is going to mean the end of banks as we know them - a complete override of the financial sector. This will revolutionize how we handle our money and empower individuals to decide how they will save, invest and spend.</p>\r\n<p>Wharton is already <a href=\"http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/thought-leadership/wharton-at-work/2015/01/leadership-in-financial-inclusion\">leading the discussion</a> on multiple fronts with Wharton FinTech, the financial inclusion team in the Wharton Social Venture Fund and their Leadership and Diversity for Innovation Program in partnership with Women\u2019s World Banking, Credit Suisse and Cisco. FinTech\u2019s role in social impact still has a ways to go, but I think it\u2019s safe to say Wharton is at the front of the wave.</p>\r\n",
